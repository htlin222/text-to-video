Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the estimated global incidence of myocarditis was 1 to 10 cases per 100,000 persons per year.12 The highest risk was among people between 20 and 40 years of age and among men. In the 35-to-39-year-old age group, the rate was 6.1 cases per 100,000 men and 4.4 cases per 100,000 women, with similar rates in the 20-to-44-year-old age group.13 The increased use of cardiac MRI has led to a gradual rise in the reported incidence of myocarditis in the United States, from 9.5 to 14.4 cases per 100,000 persons.14
