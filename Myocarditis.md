## Myocarditis ## REVIEW ARTICLE
According to the 1995 World Health Organization task force on cardiomyopathies, myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium that is diagnosed on the basis of established histologic, immunologic, and immunohistochemical criteria.1 Since the introduction of the Dallas criteria in 1987,2 endomyocardial biopsy has been considered the standard method of diagnosis.3-7 Over the past two decades, however, the diagnostic workup has changed with the introduction of new tools, mainly highly sensitive troponin and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)8,9; in routine clinical practice, a combination of symptoms and signs, laboratory testing, and imaging studies is often sufficient to establish the diagnosis.
The definition and diagnosis of myocarditis vary widely. For myocarditis associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) or with Covid-19 vaccination, the diagnostic criteria have been adapted from those established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Brighton Collaboration.
## Epidemiology ## Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the estimated global incidence of myocarditis was 1 to 10 cases per 100,000 persons per year.12 The highest risk was among people between 20 and 40 years of age and among men. In the 35-to-39-year-old age group, the rate was 6.1 cases per 100,000 men and 4.4 cases per 100,000 women, with similar rates in the 20-to-44-year-old age group.13 The increased use of cardiac MRI has led to a gradual rise in the reported incidence of myocarditis in the United States, from 9.5 to 14.4 cases per 100,000 persons.
