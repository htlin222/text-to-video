## Technical Aspects ## A plain abdominal radiograph must be read with a complete knowledge of the clinical situation. The patient's history and results of the physical examination and laboratory studies are always important to evaluate an acute abdomen, which may be caused by various different diseases. Obtaining plain films with the patient supine and erect and that include the diaphragm is the classic approach. Because chest abnormalities may produce an acute abdomen, a chest posteroanterior radiograph is sometimes ordered.

The standard abdominal radiograph is a supine projection: x-rays are passed from front to back (anteroposterior projection) in a patient lying on his or her back ( [Figure 1-1](https://www-clinicalkey-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/f0010) ). In some circumstances, an abdominal radiograph taken with the patient erect is requested; its advantage over a supine film is the visualization of air/fluid levels. A decubitus film (with the patient lying on his or her side) is also of use in certain situations, especially to visualize fluid levels in the large bowel.

It is important, as with any imaging technique, that the technical details of an abdominal radiograph are assessed. The date the film was taken and the name, age, and sex of the patient are all worth noting. This ensures you are reviewing the correct film with the correct clinical information, and it also may aid your interpretation. Unless the order is specifically labeled, the film is taken with the patient supine. The best way to appreciate normality is to look at as many films as possible, with an awareness of anatomy in mind. Although an abdominal radiograph is a plain radiograph, it has a radiation dose equivalent to 50 posteroanterior chest radiographs or 6 months of standard background radiation.

## Pros and Cons

Many techniques may be used to acquire images of the abdomen, including ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the plain abdominal radiograph is the technique that is most readily available in the emergency situation when a patient presents with acute abdominal pain.

Radiographs should never be requested without due consideration. They expend resources and expose the patient to ionizing radiation. They are an adjunct to a careful history and thorough physical examination.

The abdominal radiograph has the advantage of low cost. It is easy to perform and can be done on uncooperative patients, and, if correctly carried out and carefully interpreted, it can still be used with a dual purpose. It can be used to evaluate catheter placement; identify ingested, inhaled, or introduced foreign bodies or free air in patients with a gastrointestinal perforation (conditions for which the examination is often diagnostic); or assess a condition of intestinal occlusion or an abdomen in the postoperative phase. It also can be of use in documenting the intestinal morphodynamics, the findings of which at the direct examination of the abdomen depend on both the cause of the acute pathologic process and the time when the examination is performed with respect to the onset of the insult. In addition, plain abdominal radiographs are an accessible, relatively inexpensive, convenient, and accurate method of detecting retained surgical needles. They can be used effectively to locate needles over 10 mm in length retained in the abdomen, with a sensitivity of 92% in this size range. In this scenario, plain abdominal radiographs should continue to be used after incorrect needle counts. It is also recommended that the requesting physician provide the radiologist the size of the lost needle. However, for missing needles of 10 mm or less in length, the utility of plain abdominal radiographs is more debatable.

Conversely, criticisms of requests for abdominal films often quote a low number of cases in which the diagnosis or management was changed by the radiographic findings. The diagnostic value is questionable, and very often there is no clear indication. In the majority of cases, the results are negative or nonspecific. In fact, as reported in a recent article by Kellow and colleagues, the results of abdominal radiography are neither sensitive nor specific. Flak and Rowley suggested that there are only two clinical entities in which sensitivity of abdominal radiography approaches 100%: free intraperitoneal air and, to a lesser extent, bowel obstruction. For the latter indication, a prospective trial conducted by Frager and associates determined that clinical and radiographic evaluation was never precise enough to provide the exact location or cause of small bowel obstruction. Furthermore, Taourel and coworkers demonstrated that not only is CT valuable in making a more accurate diagnosis but also that clinical treatment was correctly modified in 21% of patients because of the additional information provided by using CT. Therefore, abdominal radiography appears of limited value in the initial diagnosis of obstruction. For the indication of free air, the diagnosis is better made by evaluation of a chest radiograph obtained with the patient erect. In addition, only a few physicians are aware of the relatively high radiation dose of an abdominal film, which is equal to 50 chest radiographs.

## Controversies

In the 1950s, gastrointestinal radiology consisted of plain abdominal films and single-contrast barium studies to assess gastrointestinal diseases. Today, the plain radiograph still may be the first step to evaluate acute abdominal diseases. However, with the advent of CT and ultrasonography, the importance of the plain abdominal film is decreasing. In past years, plain radiography was also used to help diagnose abdominal pathologic processes such as stones in the kidney, gallbladder, or bladder. Plain radiography is now limited to emergency radiology in the acute abdomen. However, despite the undoubted advantages of the speed of examination, the multiplanar capabilities, and the objectivity of interpretation, CT subjects the patient to a higher dose of ionizing radiation. The role of plain radiography of the abdomen in the diagnosis of acute abdomen needs to be reconsidered. According to some authors, plain radiography should be performed only in patients for whom there are known advantages, such as in the case of suspected gastrointestinal perforation, intestinal occlusion, ingestion of or the search for foreign bodies, and assessment of the postoperative abdomen ; in these cases, it is still the examination of choice, and only if it does not prove diagnostic should a CT examination be recommended. In addition to these situations, however, there is another indication: the ability of plain radiography to assess the evolution of intestinal morphodynamism, that is, the variations in the motility, shape, and position of the small bowel in acute pathologic conditions. Even though in the first instance assessing the cause or the precise site of the obstruction is advisable, differentiating at least a mechanical ileus from a paralytic ileus, and above all having an understanding of the seriousness and the extension of the cause and the time elapsed since its onset can prove clinically more useful. Few comparisons of plain abdominal radiographs and CT scans exist in the literature. Siewert and associates reported on 91 admitted patients with acute abdominal pain who eventually received CT because of continuing symptoms or failure to respond to therapy. In this series, treatment was changed after CT in 25 patients (27%), but the authors did not state the relative contribution of the plain abdominal radiographs to the pre-CT diagnosis. In particular, the percentage of patients who had abnormal plain abdominal radiographs was not given. A retrospective review of 23 patients with proved mesenteric infarction compared plain abdominal radiographs with CTs and showed that 6 patients (26%) had abnormal plain abdominal radiographs only, 8 patients (35%) had abnormal CTs only, and in only 1 patient (4%) were both tests abnormal. Both studies were normal or nonspecific in 8 patients (35%). That 26% of patients had signs of an acute abdominal syndrome shown only on plain abdominal radiographs and not on CT is in sharp contradiction to our findings, in which the plain abdominal radiographs provided minimal additional information in 2 of 74 patients (3%) and at the cost of 33 (57%) potentially misleading false-negative results. There are several possible explanations. Mesenteric infarction may represent one of a series of specific syndromes that have either relatively low CT sensitivity, high plain abdominal radiograph sensitivity, or both. In the review just cited, no patients were diagnosed on plain abdominal radiographs, CT, or clinical course with this syndrome. Other possibilities include individual or institutional variations in radiologic interpretations or improvement in the interpretation of CTs for this and other syndromes over the past decade. The increased imaging capabilities of this newer technology would most likely make the test characteristics of the newer CT scanners even more favorable. Despite these limitations, for emergency department patients with acute abdominal, flank, or back pain, in whom a CT is likely to be obtained, a preliminary plain abdominal radiograph adds almost no additional information and is potentially misleading. Given the utilization of resources required for plain abdominal radiographs as well as the time delay to obtain them, some authors believe that patients in whom the clinical suspicion of significant intra-abdominal pathology is high should go directly to CT.

## Normal Anatomy

As with any plain radiograph, only five main densities may be distinguished, four of which are natural: black for gas, white for calcified structures, gray representing a host of soft tissue, and a slightly darker gray for fat (because it absorbs slightly fewer x-rays). Metallic objects are seen as an intense bright white. The clarity of outlines of structures depends, therefore, on the differences among these densities. On the chest radiograph, this is easily shown by the contrast between lung and ribs as black air against the white calcium-containing bones. These differences are much less apparent on the abdominal radiograph because most structures are of similar density, mainly soft tissue. A systematic approach to plain abdominal radiographs will help avoid errors in interpretation. Interpretation of the abdominal radiograph depends on the assessment of the bowel gas pattern, solid organ outlines, a search for abnormal calcification, and a review of the skeleton. A search should be made for extraluminal gas. A bowel gas pattern distinguishing the colon from the small bowel may be difficult. The presence of solid feces and the distribution, caliber, and mucosal pattern of the bowel help in deciding whether a particular loop of bowel is stomach, small intestine, or colon. The presence of solid feces indicates the large bowel, which also may be recognized by the incomplete haustral band crossing the colonic gas shadow. Haustra are usually present in the ascending and transverse colon but may be absent from the splenic flexure and descending colon. The valvulae conniventes of the small bowel are closer together and cross the width of the bowel. The distal ileum when dilated can appear smooth, which makes differentiation more difficult. The small bowel when obstructed is generally centrally positioned with numerous loops of tighter curvature than the large bowel. Maximal small bowel caliber is 3.5 cm in the jejunum and 2.5 cm in the ileum. Maximal caliber of the transverse colon on plain films is taken to be 5.5 cm in diameter, and the maximal cecal diameter is 9 cm. Solid organs, the liver edge, renal outlines, and the splenic tip may all be demonstrated.

## Intraluminal Gas

One should begin by looking at the amount and distribution of gas in the bowels (intraluminal gas). There is considerable normal variation in the distribution of bowel gas ( [Figure 1-2](https://www-clinicalkey-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/f0015) ). On the abdominal radiograph taken with the patient erect, the gastric gas bubble in the left upper quadrant of the film is a normal finding. Gas is also normally seen within the large bowel, most notably the transverse colon and rectum. Small and large bowel also can be distinguished, most easily when dilated, by their different mucosal markings. Small bowel has valvulae conniventes that traverse the full width of the bowel; large bowel has haustra that cross only part of the bowel wall. These features are important in the next part of this series, which considers abnormal intraluminal gas. Occasionally, fluid levels in the small bowel are a normal finding. Fecal matter in the bowel gives a “mottled” appearance. This is seen as a mixture of gray densities representing a gas/liquid/solid mixture.

Figure 1-2

Diverticulitis and peridiverticulitis. There is no evidence of bowel distention at the level of either the colon or the small bowel. It is possible to see a mild air dilation of the small bowel. The cecum seems to be medially moved *(arrow).*

## Extraluminal Gas

Gas outside the bowel lumen is invariably abnormal ( [Figure 1-3](https://www-clinicalkey-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/f0020) ). The largest volume of gas one might see is likely to be under the right diaphragm; this occurs after a viscus has been perforated. This gas within the peritoneal cavity is termed *pneumoperitoneum.* Gas in the right upper quadrant within the biliary tree is a “normal” finding after sphincterotomy or biliary surgery, but it can indicate the presence of a fistula between the biliary tree and the gut. One must beware of gas in the portal vein, because this can look very similar to biliary air. Gas in the portal vein is always pathologic and frequently fatal. It occurs in ischemic states, such as toxic megacolon, and it may be accompanied by gas within the bowel wall (intramural gas) ( [Box 1-1](https://www-clinicalkey-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/b0010) ).

Furthermore, extracolonic air collections are visible at the spleen level *(arrowhead)* in the upper left quadrant. Bowel dilation is evident without the finding of bowel obstruction.

## Calcification

Calcium is visible in a variety of structures, both normal and abnormal, and becomes more common with advancing age. Calcification should be identified and anatomically located. In some locations (e.g., vascular calcification), it is common and benign. Vascular calcification may be seen within the aorta, in the splenic artery in the left upper quadrant, or in the pelvis. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are usually below the second lumbar vertebra. Calcification can make them obvious and can give a rough indication of the internal diameter. Abdominal ultrasonography is required for accurate assessment and to determine the need for surgery or follow-up. Uterine fibroids can become calcified.

Calcified renal tract stones should be looked for around the renal outlines and down the line of the ureters. More rarely, calcified gallstones are seen in the right upper quadrant or a calcified (porcelain) gallbladder is present. The pancreas lies at the level of the T9 to T12 vertebrae. Calcification occurs in chronic pancreatitis and may show the whole outline of the gland.

In the pelvic region, bladder calculi may occasionally be seen. Bladder stones are usually quite large and often multiple. Calcification of a bladder tumor also may occur. Schistosomiasis may produce calcification of the bladder wall.

Other causes of pelvic calcification include phleboliths, calcified fibroids, and, rarely, calcification in ovarian dermoids, which may also contain teeth and hair.

## Soft Tissues and Bone

A review of the soft tissues entails evaluating the outlines of the major abdominal organs. Observing these structures is made easier by the fatty rim (properitoneal fat lines) surrounding them. In fact, the loss of these fat planes may indicate an ongoing pathologic process, such as peritonitis.

The liver is seen in the right upper quadrant and extends downward a variable distance. The tip of the right lobe may be seen extending below the right kidney; this is a normal variant called Riedel's lobe. The spleen may be visualized (especially in thin individuals) even when of normal size. It enlarges inferiorly and toward the left lower quadrant. It is often possible to identify both kidneys and the psoas shadows within the retroperitoneum. The kidneys are lateral to the midline in the region of the T12 to L2 vertebrae. ( *N ote :* A useful way to identify vertebrae is that the lowest one to give off a rib is T12 and thus can serve as a reference point.)

Soft tissue masses or abscess can sometimes be identified on plain films. An abscess generally has a rather heterogeneous density because of the presence of gas and necrotic tissue. Mass lesions are of soft tissue density and will displace bowel gas shadows.

The assessment of bones entails evaluating the spine and pelvis for evidence of a bony pathologic process. Osteoarthritis frequently affects the vertebral bodies, as well as the femoral and the acetabular components of the hip joint. Paget's disease may be identified commonly along the iliopectineal lines of the pelvis. The bone survey should also include a check for fractures, especially subtle femoral neck fractures in elderly persons. The spine and pelvis are also common locations for metastatic deposits. In the spine, this is classically seen as “the absent pedicle.”

## Artifacts

“Human-made” structures should be correctly identified. These may be iatrogenic (put there by health care professionals), accidental (put there by the patient or another person), or projectional (lying in front of or behind the abdomen but spuriously projected within it on the abdominal radiograph). Examples of iatrogenic structures would be surgical clips, an intrauterine contraceptive device, a renal or biliary stent, an endoluminal aortic stent, or an inferior vena cava filter. Accidental findings include bullets or an object in the rectum. Projectional findings include pajama buttons, coins in pockets, or body piercings.

## Pathologic Findings

Abdominal radiographs obtained with the patient erect are requested to look for fluid levels in obstruction or ileus. Air under the diaphragm may be seen in an erect film if the bowel has been perforated, although a chest radiograph is more commonly obtained to look for that sign ( [Figure 1-4](https://www-clinicalkey-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/f0025) ). An abdominal radiograph is of no value in hematemesis. Avoiding obtaining erect films when unnecessary and avoiding plain films for hematemesis will reduce the level of radiation exposure.

Wide sickle-shaped free air is evident under the right hemidiaphragm *(large arrow).* A small, linear, free air collection is also shown along the lower margin of the liver *(small arrows).* Marked air distention of jejunum with a transitional area between dilated jejunum and normal ileum is visible *(arrowheads).*

## Renal Colic

If a patient presents with groin pain, the possibility of renal colic is high; therefore, a kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB) view is requested. Approximately 90% of renal stones are radiopaque. Uric acid stones may be missed. False-positive findings may occur from phleboliths, which are most common in the pelvic veins, and false-negative findings occur from small stones. On the right, calcification may represent gallstones but only a minority of gallstones are radiopaque. The presence of gallstones does not confirm biliary colic as the cause of pain because gallstones become more frequent with age and are often asymptomatic.

## Intestinal Obstruction

Erect and supine films are used to confirm the diagnosis. Obstruction of the small bowel shows a ladder-like series of small bowel loops, but this also occurs with an obstruction of the proximal colon. Fluid levels in the bowel can be seen in upright views. Distended loops may be absent if obstruction is at the upper jejunum. Obstruction of the large bowel is more gradual in onset than small bowel obstruction. The colon is in the more peripheral part of the film, and distention may be very marked. Fluid levels also will be seen in paralytic ileus when bowel sounds will be reduced or absent rather than loud and tinkling as in obstruction. In an erect film, a fluid level in the stomach is normal, as may be a level in the cecum. Multiple fluid levels and distention of the bowel are abnormal.

## Perforation of the Intestine

If the bowel has been perforated and a significant amount of gas has been released, it will show as a translucency under the diaphragm on an erect film. Gas will also be found under the diaphragm for some time after laparotomy or laparoscopy.

## Appendicitis

An appendicolith may be apparent in an inflamed appendix in 15% of cases, but as a diagnostic point in the management of appendicitis the plain radiograph is of very limited value, although it may be of value in infants.

## Intussusception

Intussusception occurs in adults and children. A plain abdominal radiograph may show some characteristic gas patterns. A sensitivity and specificity of 90% adds to this rather difficult diagnosis, but ultrasonography is vastly superior.

## Body Packers

An increasing problem occurs with people who swallow drugs, usually in condoms, to evade detection. There may be signs that the drugs are leaking, but the carrier is unwilling to disclose the fact for fear of a long prison term, even at risk to life. A plain abdominal radiograph will show 90% of cases, but there will be false-positive findings in 3%. Therefore, a positive result is likely to be true but a negative result does not exclude the clinical suspicion adequately and an ultrasound examination may be considered ( [Boxes 1-2](https://www-clinicalkey-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/b0015) and [1-3](https://www-clinicalkey-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/b0020) ).

## Pathophysiology

## Small Bowel

The small bowel contains a small amount to no gas in normal individuals, so it is not visible on a plain film. The presence of more gas than normal should be viewed with suspicion and interpreted in the proper clinical setting. Some clinical situations, such as indigestion or viral enteritis, show an increase of intestinal gas, usually without air/fluid levels; these are self-limiting diseases, and usually they do not need diagnostic efforts.

Intestinal obstruction is a common radiographic finding in an emergency department. Distended intestinal loops with air/fluid levels with scarcely visible colonic gas are among the most commonly seen features of small bowel obstruction; the clinical history of the patient may be the key to the diagnosis in the case of suspected postoperative adhesions, Crohn's disease, or a known tumor. In some cases, however, depending on the gas and fluid distribution it is not impossible to have a near-normal plain film with a true obstruction. On the other hand, diffuse peritoneal metastasis may produce air/fluid levels without obstruction. The level of the intestinal obstruction may be, in some cases, understood; however, in prestenotic loops the fluid may be abundant and gas not visible so that only proximal loops are distended by gas. Again, fluid-filled intestinal loops showing the cause of obstruction either of the bowel wall or extraintestinal are often easily seen at CT. The diagnosis of strangulation requires expertise because the intramural gas and a rigid loop are well-known features but not so commonly seen. It should be remembered that the shape of valvulae conniventes is also generally preserved in severe distention so that they can be used to differentiate small intestinal disease from colonic disease.

The adhesions are not directly seen, but a transition zone (dilatation of the bowel followed by a collapsed loop) without any other visible cause of obstruction may lead to the diagnosis in a patient with a history of surgery.

CT performed after a plain abdominal film can be obtained without oral contrast administration, but intravenous administration of a contrast agent usually cannot be avoided in these often severely ill patients.

A set of CT criteria that may help surgeons decide if a patient needs surgery for small bowel obstruction has been implemented. Although plain radiography can be used with good results by experienced surgeons, CT has been reported to have 100% sensitivity in complete obstruction. Daneshmand and colleagues compared CT to plain radiography and found a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 53% for plain film, respectively, and 92% and 71% for CT; they suggest that CT can be used as the primary diagnostic tool for small bowel obstruction. The approach to evaluate patients with small bowel obstruction is not generally accepted; however, CT is considered the preeminent imaging modality to evaluate these patients.

## Colon

Because of the presence of haustra, feces, and gas, understanding diseases of the colon is apparently easier than recognizing diseases of the small bowel on a plain radiograph. An obstruction of the sigmoid colon shows the transition from a dilated to a nondilated colon, and it is not difficult to recognize. On the other hand, an obstruction of the ascending colon may be similar, in some cases, to an obstruction of the last ileal loop. Colonic obstruction producing a severe cecal dilatation greater than 10 to 11 cm is an indication for immediate surgery, to avoid perforation. In elderly constipated patients, a sigmoid volvulus is among the possible causes of obstruction; the dilated sigmoid that is seen as a “kidney bean” also may mimic an abdominal mass. Cecal volvulus, seen in younger patients, produces distention of the cecum ( [Figure 1-5](https://www-clinicalkey-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/f0030) ). In both cases, CT can provide crucial information.

Volvulus. Visible fecal material *(arrow)* is evident in the right colon, whereas the left and sigmoid colon are not represented. Moderate distention of bowel in the upper abdomen can be seen. In the left lower quadrant, a mass is suspected because of the lack of intestinal air.

Severe clinical situations such as perirectal or perisigmoidal abscesses or a carcinoma infiltrating bowel wall without obstruction may have a completely normal appearance on a plain film ( [Figure 1-6](https://www-clinicalkey-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/f0035) ); these situations are easily seen on CT.

Perisigmoid abscess. Note enlargement of the hepatic area *(arrowheads).* Small bowel and colon are within the normal range for size.

Distention of the colon, often accompanied with diffuse distention of the small bowel without mechanical obstruction, is the feature of paralytic or adynamic ileus. The intestinal distention may be limited to some part of the intestine so that it may be difficult to distinguish mechanical from paralytic ileus. The clinical situation of the patient may be enough, in some cases, to make the diagnosis. If the diagnosis is not clear, CT is mandatory.

Ischemic bowel disease produces many different abnormalities on a plain radiograph, ranging from intestinal distention to a gasless abdomen. “Thumbprinting” is a famous, but not so specific, feature of intestinal ischemia. A linear shadow of gas within the bowel wall is difficult to detect on a plain film; when visible, it indicates a poor prognosis.

Toxic megacolon may be a lethal complication of ulcerative colitis. A plain film shows a dilatation of the transverse colon greater than 6 to 8 cm with loss of haustra. The loss of a haustral pattern is important to distinguish a patient with an obstruction of the distal colon from a patient with colitis, in which a haustral pattern is usually lost, even with mild disease. Small bowel distention, often with air/fluid levels, may be seen in a subgroup of patients with severe ulcerative colitis at higher risk for both toxic megacolon and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The poor response to therapy and the persistence of gastrointestinal distention are monitored with plain radiography, which is important to evaluate patients who need colectomy.

## Miscellaneous Findings

Free intraperitoneal or subphrenic air is commonly seen in postoperative patients, and the only thing to do is wait for its resorption. A deep intestinal or colonic biopsy also can produce, as a rare complication, free or subphrenic air collection. Perforation of a duodenal ulcer or perforation of a diverticulum of the colon are not as common causes of extraintestinal air collections.

Cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and other causes of acute abdomen in which a collection of air or fluid may be misleading should now be assessed by ultrasonography or CT. Fecaloma is easy to detect on a plain film; however, a digital exploration of the rectum is preferred to diagnose this lesion.

## Key Points

*The history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are always important to evaluate an acute abdomen, which may be caused by a number of different diseases.*

*Plain radiography should be performed as an initial imaging modality in patients for whom there are known advantages, such as those with suspected gastrointestinal perforation, intestinal occlusion, and ingestion of or in a search for foreign bodies, and in the assessment of the postoperative abdomen to detect retained needles. In addition, another indication is the ability of plain radiography to assess the evolution of intestinal morphodynamism, which is the variation in the motility, shape, and position of the small bowel in acute pathologic conditions.*

*The lack of positive findings on abdominal radiography is falsely reassuring in nontrauma emergency department patients.* *Further imaging is often required to better characterize abnormalities identified at abdominal radiography.*
