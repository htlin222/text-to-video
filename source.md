Hemoptysis is the expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract. Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract (hematemesis) or nasal cavities (epistaxis) can mimic hemoptysis. Once established as hemoptysis, the degree of blood that is being expectorated (volume and frequency) is the next step as massive or life-threatening hemoptysis (>400 mL of blood in 24 h or >150 mL at one time) requires emergent intervention. This chapter will focus predominantly on nonâ€“life-threatening hemoptysis. The source of the bleeding as well as the cause are the next steps when approaching a patient with hemoptysis.
