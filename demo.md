# CHAPTER ONE

## Structure and Function

THIS CHAPTER DISCUSSES the minimum amount of structure and function that we need to understand mechanical ventilation. Although the two are intimately related, Iâ€™ve separated them for ease of study. The structure section is short, simple, and reviews only the relevant structural elements. The function section is the most important in this book; understanding the rest of this book relies on understanding it.
