# CHAPTER ONE

## Structure and Function

THIS CHAPTER DISCUSSES the minimum amount of structure and function that we need to understand mechanical ventilation. Although the two are intimately related, Iâ€™ve separated them for ease of study. The structure section is short, simple, and reviews only the relevant structural elements. The function section is the most important in this book; understanding the rest of this book relies on understanding it.

In a simplified view, we can think of the respiratory system as being made of just two parts: a gas conduction system and a gas exchange system. ![STRUCTURE OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM](https://i.imgur.com/1DBVTtd.png)

## Structure of the Gas Conduction System

The gas conduction system comprises the hollow airways through which gas moves into and out of the lungs. It begins at the vocal cords as the trachea. Like a tree, it branches out and divides until it reaches the acini. The trachea is sturdy, reinforced by cartilage and connective tissues. With each division, the airways progressively narrow and lose the cartilage and other support elements. After around 16 divisions, the airways will have become numerous, thin, and flimsy.

## The Small Airways

## Flimsy

The respiratory system ends with millions of gas exchanging acini. Each acinus has to be reached by the gas conduction system. To fit millions of tiny tubes into the space of a chest, it strips these tubes of almost all supportive tissues. The lack of supportive tissue makes the small airways flimsy and prone to collapse. In contrast to the larger airways whose muscular and cartilaginous components prop them open, the tension from attached surrounding tissues is what holds open these smallest airways.
