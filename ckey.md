## Aspiration

## 1

## What is aspiration?

Aspiration is the passage of material from the pharynx into the trachea. Aspirated material can originate from the stomach, esophagus, mouth, or nose. The materials involved can be particulate matter (e.g., food), a foreign body, fluid (e.g., blood, saliva) or gastrointestinal contents. Aspiration can cause a pneumonitis or a pneumonia, with the former occurring most often as a complication on induction of anesthesia.

## 2

## What differentiates aspiration pneumonitis from aspiration pneumonia?

The primary pathophysiology of aspiration pneumonitis is *acute inflammation* because of chemical irritation of the tracheobronchial tree, caused by sterile, acidic, gastric contents containing digestive enzymes and bile acids. Aspiration pneumonia, however, is primarily *infectious* because of aspiration of bacteria in patients who are frail, elderly, and/or immunocompromised, and is associated with poor dentition and dysphagia. A key differentiating factor between aspiration pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia is the acidity and source of the vomitus. Aspiration of acidic gastric contents not only irritates the tracheobronchial tree directly, but also activates digestive enzymes (i.e., pepsinogen), which may contribute to aspiration pneumonitis. The source of the vomitus in aspiration pneumonitis is the stomach, whereas aspiration pneumonia is often caused by bacteria from the oropharynx. Aspiration pneumonia, however, can be caused by the aspiration of gastric contents particularly if patients are on proton-pump inhibitors or histamine-2 (H2) antagonist, which increases the gastric pH, leading to gastric colonization of bacteria. The presentation of aspiration pneumonitis is more acute than aspiration pneumonia and is more commonly associated with anesthesia.

## 3

## How is aspiration pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia treated?

Aspiration pneumonitis is treated with supportive care and aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics. It is important to note that there is a degree of overlap between aspiration pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis, and some patients with aspiration pneumonitis can develop a pneumonia.

## What is Mendelson syndrome?

Mendelson syndrome was the first description of aspiration pneumonitis in the literature. An obstetrician named Curtis Mendelson described this syndrome as dyspnea, cyanosis, and tachycardia in obstetric patients who had aspirated while receiving general anesthesia. He also described the immediate complications of aspiration pneumonitis as asthma-like (bronchospasm, wheezing, hypercapnia, etc.), which occurred if the gastric contents were acidic, whereas if the aspiration volume was large and not acidic, the respiratory pathology was caused by obstruction of the airways leading to atelectasis and hypoxemia. He distinguished the pathology of aspiration pneumonitis as irritative as opposed to aspiration pneumonia, which is infectious. This landmark paper shaped our current preoperative fasting guidelines to reduce gastric volumes and improved our anesthetic techniques for patients at risk for aspiration, such as giving preoperative medications to neutralize gastric pH and performing rapid sequence induction and intubation (also known as rapid sequence induction \[RSI\]).

## 5

## What are the specific risk factors for a vomitus to cause aspiration pneumonitis?

The two primary risk factors for the development of aspiration pneumonitis are the following:

*   1)

    pH of gastric contents under 2.5

*   2)

    Gastric volumes over 25 mL


Aspiration of gastric contents containing small volumes (< 25 mL) and low acidity (pH > 2.5) are less likely to cause clinically significant aspiration pneumonitis.

## 6

## How often does aspiration occur with anesthesia, and what is the morbidity and mortality rate?

The incidence of significant aspiration is 1 per 10,000 anesthetics. Studies of anesthetics in children demonstrate about twice that occurrence. The average hospital stay after aspiration is 21 days, much of which may be in intensive care. Complications range from bronchospasm, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), lung abscess, and empyema. The average mortality rate is 5%.

## 7

## What are risk factors for aspiration with anesthesia?

It is important to emphasize that aspiration risk is not binary and that a continuum exists between low and high risk. Risk factors for aspiration include the following:

*   •

    Extremes of age

*   •

    Emergency operations

*   •

    Type of surgery (most common in cases of esophageal, upper abdominal, or emergent laparotomy operations)

*   •

    Recent meal

*   •

    Delayed gastric emptying (narcotics, diabetes, trauma, pain, intraabdominal infections, and end-stage renal disease)

*   •

    Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD; decreased lower esophageal sphincter tone, hiatal hernia)

*   •

    Trauma

*   •

    Pregnancy

*   •

    Depressed level of consciousness (i.e., Glasgow Coma Scale < 8)

*   •

    Morbid obesity (higher incidence of hiatal hernia)

*   •

    Difficult airway

*   •

    Neuromuscular disease (impaired ability to protect their airway)

*   •

    Esophageal disease (e.g., scleroderma, achalasia, diverticulum, Zenker diverticulum, prior esophagectomy/gastrectomy)



## 8

## What precautions can be undertaken before anesthetic induction to prevent aspiration or mitigate its sequelae?

The main precaution is to recognize which patients are at risk. Patients having elective surgical procedures should be fasted per American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines. Before anesthetic induction, oral nonparticulate antacids, such as sodium citrate can be administered to patients at risk for aspiration (e.g., severe uncontrolled GERD). This functions to raise the gastric pH and lessen the severity of the pneumonitis if aspiration were to occur. H2-receptor antagonists (e.g., cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine) can be used to raise the gastric pH as well, but must be administered approximately 30 to 60 minutes before induction of anesthesia to be effective. The use of proton-pump inhibitors in place of, or in concert with, H2 antagonists has not proven to be more efficacious. The use of orogastric or nasogastric drainage before induction is most effective in patients with intestinal obstruction. In situ nasogastric tubes should be suctioned before induction in this patient population.

## 9

## How should anesthesia be induced in patients at risk for aspiration?

RSI and intubation is the gold standard in rapidly securing an airway in patients at risk of aspiration. This process involves administering rapid acting neuromuscular blocking agents, cricoid pressure, and the avoidance of mask ventilation. Discussions on the efficacy and potential hazards of cricoid pressure continue, but to date it continues to be recommended for RSI and intubation. A regional anesthetic with little to no sedation is a potential alternative in patients at risk of aspiration, such as obstetric patients undergoing a cesarean section with a spinal anesthetic. Patients with difficult airways may require an awake intubation; however, overly sedating or topicalization of the patient’s airway with local anesthetic may compromise the patient’s ability to protect their airway. Therefore patients at risk for aspiration undergoing an awake intubation should remain awake with little to no sedation given and topical local anesthetic should only be applied above the glottis to preserve airway reflects below this anatomic level.

## 10

## Review the clinical signs and symptoms after aspiration.

Fever occurs in over 90% of aspiration cases, with tachypnea and rales in at least 70%. Cough, cyanosis, and wheezing occur in 30% to 40% of cases. Aspiration may occur silently—without the anesthesiologist's knowledge—during anesthesia. Any of the previous clinical deviations from the expected course may signal an aspiration event. Radiographic changes may take hours to occur and may be negative, especially if radiographic images are taken soon after an event.

## 11

## When is a patient suspected of aspiration believed to be out of danger?

The patient who shows none of the previously mentioned signs or symptoms and has no increased oxygen requirement at the end of 2 hours is likely to recover completely.

## 12

## Describe the treatment for aspiration.

Immediate suctioning should be instituted through the endotracheal tube, immediately after intubation, before the initiation of positive pressure ventilation. Any patient who is thought to have aspirated should receive a chest radiograph and, at a minimum, several hours of observation. Supportive care remains the mainstay for aspiration pneumonitis. Supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support should be initiated if respiratory failure is a problem. Patients with respiratory failure often demonstrate atelectasis with alveolar collapse and may respond to noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure). Patients with particulate aspirate may need bronchoscopy to remove the larger obstructing particulate matter. Antibiotics should not generally be administered unless there is a high likelihood that gram-negative or anaerobic organisms (i.e., bowel obstruction) have been aspirated. However, a worsening clinical course over the following days suggests pneumonia and that a broad-spectrum antibiotic may be indicated. Routine bronchial alveolar lavage of the trachea after aspiration has not been shown to be helpful and may worsen the patient's condition. More aggressive treatments for severe aspiration usually occur in the critical care setting (e.g., prone positioning, lung protection ventilation strategies, bronchoscopy).

Key Points: Aspiration

*   1.

    There are two types of aspiration: aspiration pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia. The former is primarily irritative and obstructive in pathology, whereas the latter is primarily infectious.

*   2.

    Aspiration pneumonitis is most commonly seen on induction of anesthesia, whereas aspiration pneumonia is more common in patients who are elderly, immunocompromised, have impaired cognition or levels of consciousness, have poor dentition, and have dysphagia.

*   3.

    Aspiration risk is not binary, and a continuum exists between low and high risk.

*   4.

    Risk factors for aspiration include patients presenting for emergent operations, recent or unknown oral intake, bowel obstruction, conditions associated with delayed gastric emptying (diabetes, opioids, intraabdominal infections, severe pain), uncontrolled GERD, obesity, trauma, pregnancy, and patients who cannot protect their airway.

*   5.

    Risk factors for aspiration pneumonitis include large gastric volumes (> 25 mL) and acidic gastric contents (pH < 2.5).

*   6.

    Patients at elevated aspiration risk may require prophylaxis to decrease the severity of aspiration should it occur (nonparticulate antacids, H2 blockers, etc.). Patients with bowel obstruction should receive gastric decompression with a nasogastric tube before induction of anesthesia.

*   7.

    RIS and intubation with cricoid pressure and a fast-acting neuromuscular blocking agent (e.g., succinylcholine) is the gold standard for patients at high risk for aspiration who need to be intubated. Regional anesthesia is also a reasonable option in motivated patients who can tolerate little to no sedation.

*   8.

    Treatment for aspiration pneumonitis is supportive, whereas patients with aspiration pneumonia need antibiotics.


## Laryngospasm

## 1

## What is laryngospasm?

Laryngospasm is a sudden, sustained closure of the vocal cords caused by a primitive airway reflex meant to prevent aspiration. In the awake state, closure of the vocal cords in response to potential aspiration can be overcome by higher cortical centers, but in light planes of anesthesia (i.e., stage 2), this reflex can be triggered without an opposing force. Oxygenation and ventilation are not possible because of the closed glottis.

## 2

## What are the potential causes of laryngospasm?

Laryngospasm typically occurs during emergence when the patient is in a light plane of anesthesia (i.e., stage 2). Stimulation of the vocal cords by excess secretions, foreign matter, or the endotracheal tube during extubation can trigger this primitive reflex. Patients who smoke, have copious secretions, had a recent upper respiratory tract infection (URI) (i.e., < 4–6 weeks), or undergoing upper airway operations (e.g., tonsillectomy) are at higher risk.

## 3

## What should you do when a patient is in laryngospasm?

During a laryngospasm episode, the priority is reopening the closed glottis so that the patient can be ventilated and oxygenated. Continuous positive pressure with a facemask along with jaw thrust and chin lift should be applied. This maneuver is often sufficient to break the laryngospasm. If this is not successful, anesthetic should be deepened and a small bolus of succinylcholine (10–20 mg intravenous \[IV\]) should be administered. Of note, if laryngospasm occurs during induction of anesthesia before establishment of IV access (more common with pediatric patients), an intramuscular injection of succinylcholine (4–5 mg/kg) should be given. After resolution of laryngospasm, ventilation should be continued with 100% oxygen. The decision to reintubate should be made on a case by case basis and should be considered if oxygenation is borderline, aspiration or pulmonary edema is suspected, or if prolonged ventilatory support is expected.

## 4

## What are the potential complications associated with laryngospasm?

Hypoxia and hypercapnia result from lack of oxygenation and ventilation during laryngospasm but should resolve once the airway is reestablished. Prolonged hypoxia after laryngospasm may be caused by aspiration or negative pressure pulmonary edema.

## 5

## What is negative pressure pulmonary edema?

Negative pressure pulmonary edema is a transudative edema produced by the negative intrathoracic pressure, generated by patient inspiratory effort against a closed glottis (i.e., laryngospasm) or other forms of obstruction (i.e., patient biting down on the endotracheal tube causing it to kink).

## 6

## Describe the mechanism of negative pressure pulmonary edema? What will be found on the chest x-ray and the arterial blood gas?

The pressure gradient between the pulmonary capillaries (positive pressure) and the alveoli (“negative” pressure) increases causing fluid to move down the pressure gradient, from the capillaries into the alveoli. The large negative intrathoracic pressure also enhances venous return to the right heart and pulmonary circulation, increasing the pulmonary capillary pressure and worsening the pulmonary edema. Although invasive monitoring is typically not used for diagnosis, patients will have a normal central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, as the cause is not cardiogenic. A chest x-ray will show bilateral fluffy pulmonary infiltrates similar to noncardiogenic (i.e., ARDS) and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Patients may have pink frothy airway secretions and the arterial blood gas would show a decreased arterial partial oxygen pressure.

## 7

## The patient is biting on the endotracheal tube on emergence from anesthesia and you are concerned the patient may develop negative pressure pulmonary edema. What can you do?

The best way to prevent this problem is to always have a bite block in place before emergence; however, sometimes the bite block may get dislodged by the patient. If this were to occur, and the patient is biting on the endotracheal tube, the most common recommended treatment options include deepening the anesthetic and/or administering a short-acting neuromuscular blocking agent. One method that the editor (Ryan Laterza) finds helpful is to immediately deflate the cuff of the endotracheal tube, as this will allow the patient to breathe around the endotracheal tube, alleviating the obstruction. A small bolus of an IV amnestic agent (e.g., propofol) can then be given, the endotracheal cuff reinflated, and the bite block replaced.

## 8

## What is the recommended treatment for negative pressure pulmonary edema?

Treatment for negative pressure pulmonary edema is supportive. Supplemental oxygen should be provided, as well as positive pressure ventilation if needed. Although furosemide may be considered, it is often not necessary as the etiology is not cardiogenic. The condition often resolves within 24 to 48 hours.

Key Points: Laryngospasm

*   1.

    Laryngospasm is an emergent situation caused by a primitive reflex, leading to glottic closure and the inability to ventilate. Patients at risk include those with preexisting reactive airways (i.e., asthma, smoking, and recent URIs) and upper airway operations or procedures associated with increased secretions (e.g., laryngoscopy, tonsillectomy, bronchoscopy).

*   2.

    Treatment of laryngospasm is aimed at reestablishing ventilation and includes an escalating algorithm of positive pressure, jaw thrust, deepening of the anesthetic, and succinylcholine.

*   3.

    Negative pressure pulmonary edema is a transudative edema that can result from negative intrathoracic pressure during laryngospasm. The condition is generally self-limited and treatment is supportive.


## Bronchospasm

## 1

## What is bronchospasm and how is it recognized in the operating room?

Bronchospasm is the reversible reflex spasm of the smooth muscle lining the pulmonary bronchioles, causing increased lower airway resistance. It can be recognized under anesthesia as the inability to ventilate a patient with a properly placed endotracheal tube, in the setting of a rapidly increasing peak inspiratory pressures. Physical examination may yield diffuse wheezing. This is typically more common in patients with asthma and usually occurs during airway instrumentation (intubation and extubation) but may occur at any point throughout the anesthetic. Bronchospasm may also be the initial presentation of an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction. Capnography will reveal a typical “shark fin” appearance with loss of the expiratory plateau ( [Fig. 31.1](https://www-clinicalkey-com.autorpa.kfsyscc.org/f0010) ). Bronchospasm is an intraoperative emergency and prompt recognition and treatment is critical.

Fig. 31.1

Changes in capnography that can be seen in bronchospasm include a “shark fin” appearance with a loss of the expiratory plateau. This pattern may also be seen in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In severe bronchospasm, the capnography waveform may decrease or even disappear if alveolar ventilation proves impossible. *EtCO* <sub><i>2 </i></sub> , End tidal carbon dioxide.

## 2

## How is bronchospasm treated?

Patients with risk factors (i.e., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent URI < 4–6 weeks) should be treated preoperatively with an inhaled β <sub>2</sub> agonist (i.e., albuterol) before the induction of anesthesia. If bronchospasm occurs intraoperatively, the following sequence of events should take place. The fraction of inspired oxygen should be increased to 100% and the volatile anesthetic should be increased because of their bronchodilator properties and ideally switched to sevoflurane. Next, an attempt to manually ventilate the patient should be undertaken to evaluate pulmonary compliance. Medication treatment includes inhaled β2 agonists via the breathing circuit and consideration for IV magnesium. In severe bronchospasm, small doses (e.g., 10–20 mcg IV) of IV epinephrine should be administered, as inhaled medications may not be effectively delivered to the distal airways. Systemic corticosteroids can be given to decrease airway inflammation and prevent the recurrence of bronchospasm. Consideration should also include changing the ventilator settings to prolong the expiratory time (inspiratory:expiratory ratio set to 1:3 or 1:4) to prevent autopositive end expiratory pressure.

Key Points: Bronchospasm

*   1.

    Bronchospasm is the reversible constriction of bronchiolar smooth muscle, which increases airway resistance and impairs alveolar ventilation.

*   2.

    Patients with asthma are at a higher risk for bronchospasm, especially during laryngoscopy and intubation.

*   3.

    Treatment of bronchospasm includes administering bronchodilator medications, such as inhaled albuterol and, in severe cases, small doses of IV epinephrine.


## Extubation

## 1

## What are the criteria for extubating a patient in the operating room?

Extubation of the trachea is a complex process that requires careful thought and consideration before action. Important factors to consider before extubation include the following: (1) Will the patient’s airway be difficult to manage with mask ventilation? (2) Was laryngoscopy and intubation difficult? (3) Has the status of the airway changed either secondary to surgery, fluid shifts, or trauma (e.g., multiple laryngoscopy attempts)? Once the decision has been made to proceed with extubation, one must ensure that the patient has met extubation criteria. Extubation criteria include adequate oxygenation, adequate ventilation, hemodynamic stability, full reversal of neuromuscular blockade, appropriate acid-base status and normothermia.

In other words, the criteria for extubation is essentially the converse for the criteria to intubate. A patient should not be extubated if they are still meeting criteria for intubation: (1) cannot protect their airway, (2) hypercarbic respiratory failure, (3) hypoxemic respiratory failure.

## 2

## What pharmacological interventions should be considered in a patient who is not meeting extubation criteria or requires immediate reintubation after extubation?

Medications given to patients during anesthesia can be a factor in the inability to extubate at the end of surgery. These medications include neuromuscular blocking agents, opioids, and benzodiazepines.

Residual neuromuscular blockade is one of the most common pharmacological causes of failed extubation. This is because residual neuromuscular blockade may impair a patient’s ability to protect their airway, cause hypercarbic respiratory failure, and in severe cases hypoxemic respiratory failure. Reversal of neuromuscular blockade is achieved with neostigmine, which is a competitive antagonist of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, patients may have an adequate minute ventilation, while intubated, but residual blockade may cause relaxation of pharyngeal muscles after the patient is extubated, leading to upper airway obstruction. Residual neuromuscular blockade presents as rapid shallow breathing, weak hand grip/head lift, and worsening hypercarbia after extubation. Additional reversal with neostigmine or with sugammadex should be considered and some patients will need to be reintubated.

Opioids decrease minute ventilation by causing a small increase in tidal volume but bigger decrease in respiratory rate. A patient that has received excessive opioid will have pinpoint pupils (miosis) and may not initiate breaths on their own. Naloxone is a competitive mu-opioid receptor antagonist used for the reversal of opioid overdose. It can be titrated in small doses (40–80 mcg IV), until the patient begins spontaneous ventilation, while keeping in mind that it will reverse the analgesia as well. Because the half-life of naloxone is shorter than that of most opioids, patients should be carefully monitored in postanesthesia care unit for several hours and the initiation of a naloxone infusion should strongly be considered. Finally, flumazenil can be given to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines with its main side effect being seizures.

## 3

## What other factors contribute to failed extubation, following emergence of anesthesia?

Aside from the pharmacological reasons explained earlier there are other considerations for the inability to extubate. During surgery, the status of the airway may change secondary to bleeding, edema, or trauma. Edema most commonly occurs in patients with prolonged prone or Trendelenburg positioning. Airway trauma can be caused by multiple laryngoscopy attempts in difficult airways or because of the surgery itself. Specific surgical operations that can affect the airway include the following: thyroid surgery, laryngoscopy, carotid endarterectomy, and anterior cervical spine surgery.

## 4

## What is the cuff-leak test?

Surgical operations near the airway, operations associated with large volume shifts, and iatrogenic airway trauma from multiple laryngoscopy attempts may cause significant airway edema. This can present as upper airway obstruction and hypercarbic respiratory failure, following extubation, but can be avoided with a cuff-leak test. The cuff-leak test involves deflating the cuff on the endotracheal tube before extubation and assessing for leaks. The qualitative method includes listening for a leak around the endotracheal tube with positive pressure ventilation. The quantitative method requires volume-controlled ventilation, where the difference between the measured inspiratory and expiratory volume by the ventilator should be greater than 20% to 30%. Patients who do not have an adequate cuff-leak should not be extubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. Treatment for a negative cuff-leak includes placing the head of bed more than 30 degrees and scheduled steroids (i.e., dexamethasone), until the airway edema resolves.

Key Points: Extubation

*   1.

    Before extubation, the anesthesiologist should take into consideration the difficulty in managing the patient’s airway, following induction of anesthesia, and other factors that could alter the patient’s airway, increasing the odds of a failed extubation and difficult reintubation. This includes airway trauma from multiple laryngoscopy attempts and airway edema from large fluid shifts.

*   2.

    Neuromuscular blocking agents and opioids are frequently implicated in patients not meeting extubation criteria or needing to be reintubated. Neuromuscular blocking agents should always be reversed before extubation and opioid overdose can be reversed with naloxone.

*   3.

    Patients with significant airway edema (large volume shifts, airway trauma, surgical operations near the airway) should be assessed with a cuff-leak before extubation.
