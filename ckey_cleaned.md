Hypercalcemia is a common complication in patients with malignancy, often seen in more advanced disease, and is associated with a poorer prognosis. Although the overall annualprevalence of hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with stage IV cancer is 1.46 to 2.74, the incidence varies widely with the type of malignancy. Adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma have the highest incidence, as high as 70% in some reports. Other malignancies such as multiple myeloma have rates of hypercalcemia around 30%. Solid tumors such as lung and breast cancers are associated with hypercalcemia about 12% and 30% of the time, respectively. Hypercalcemia of malignancy results from abnormal handling of calcium from bone resorption, intestinal absorption, or renal excretion.

## Calcium Physiology

The body's supply of calcium is divided into three separate and distinct compartments, with the skeleton having the largest calcium reserve ( [Fig. 35.1] ). The other two compartments are the intracellular fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF). The movement of calcium between compartments is regulated by physical constraints (i.e., cell membranes and calcium-binding proteins) and by hormonal regulation (parathyroid hormone \[PTH\] and vitamin D). The main concern in this chapter is a high level of calcium in the ECF and how to prevent and/or treat it in the setting of malignancy. Under normal physiologic conditions, the extracellular calcium level is highly regulated to maintain the calcium levels within a very narrow range despite constant input and outflow from other organs.

## Figure 35-1

The organs that control the ECF calcium levels are the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, kidney, and bone. Calcium intake and the resulting absorption through the GI tract is one source for increased ECF calcium (prevalent in malignancies that produce 1,25\[OH\] 2 D, which increases the absorption of calcium). Failure by the kidney to excrete calcium in large enough amounts is one of the primary mechanisms of hypercalcemia in malignancies that produce parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP), and osteoclastic resorption of bone tissue with the release of calcium into the ECF can be a direct or indirect effect of some cancers.

In normal calcium physiology, the ECF calcium is maintained in a very narrow therapeutic range. A slight drop in ECF calcium signals the release of PTH from the parathyroid glands. PTH's immediate effect is to raise the renal threshold for calcium excretion, increasing calcium reabsorption. The stimulation of 1α-hydroxylase enzyme increases the production of 1,25(OH) 2 D, which stimulates calcium absorption from the GI tract and may also stimulate the release of calcium from bone. PTH also has a direct effect on osteoblasts signaling to osteoclasts, resulting in bone tissue remodeling and calcium release. Once the ECF calcium level is restored to normal, the PTH release ceases.

The osteoclast is responsible for increasing bone resorption, and this process is tightly linked to the osteoblasts' function of bone formation. One mechanism for keeping these processes tightly linked is signaling between the cells through the RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway. RANKL is the receptor activator of nuclear factor–κB ligand. It is produced by osteoblasts and other cells by the confluence of several hormones and cytokines. RANKL stimulates osteoclast precursors to form osteoclasts; osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a natural decoy for RANKL, keeping the delicate balance between bone resorption and bone formation.

There are three main mechanisms that result in hypercalcemia of malignancy. First, the most common (80%) is tumor secretion of PTHrP, which can act similarly to PTH, resulting in hypercalcemia. Second, production of 1,25(OH) 2 D by autonomous 1α-hydroxylase in the tumor results in increased absorption of calcium. Third, osteolytic metastases can directly or indirectly increase bone resorption, mainly through the RANKL pathway.

## Parathyroid Hormone–Related Peptide

The most common cause of hypercalcemia in patients with solid tumors is the secretion of PTHrP. This is also known as humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy.This can occur with lung, head and neck, renal, bladder, breast, or ovarian cancer; non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic myeloid leukemia; and adult T-cell lymphoma. Release of PTHrP into the circulation results in stimulation of the PTH receptor in the bone and kidney. This increases bone resorption and increases the distal tubular calcium reabsorption, resulting in release of calcium from the bone as well as a decreased ability to excrete it. It is interesting to note, however, that it does not increase production of 1,25(OH) 2 D.

## 1,25(OH) 2  D Production

Under normal circumstances, many cells in the body have the machinery to convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH) 2 D with intracellular 1α-hydroxylase. Intracellular 1,25(OH) 2 D is for the cell's internal use, and after it is used it is catabolized by 24-hydroxylase to inactive 1,24,25(OH) 3 D; it is then further metabolized and excreted. It has no effect on the systemic calcium regulation, which is under the tight control of PTH. This intracellular 1α-hydroxylase production of 1,25(OH) 2 D becomes a risk for hypercalcemia when it is released into the circulation. This is an important cause of hypercalcemia in granulomatous disease, but also in Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The elevated 1,25(OH) 2 D increases GI calcium absorption and possibly bone resorption.

## Bone Resorption

The tumors that are classically associated with hypercalcemia of malignancy from increased bone resorption and the resultant release of calcium are breast cancer and multiple myeloma. Also, non–small cell lung, renal, and thyroid cancers, as well as lymphoma and melanoma, can cause osteolytic lesions. The bone resorption that occurs is primarily a result of various factors produced by tumors acting to increase osteoclast activity. For example, myeloma cells can produce RANKL, the key stimulator of physiologic osteoclast activity. Also, factors such as interleukin (IL)-6 and other cytokines directly increase osteoclast function. Breast cancer has a similar effect on osteoclasts through the production of locally produced PTHrP, which binds to marrow stromal cells that produce RANKL, which in turn stimulates osteoclasts. Because this is local production of PTHrP, it does not result in measurable systemic levels of PTHrP as in some other cancers.

## Parathyroid Hormone–Mediated Hypercalcemia

PTH-mediated causes of hypercalcemia also need to be considered as a possible mechanism of hypercalcemia associated with malignancy. The differential diagnosis includes primary hyperparathyroidism as a result of parathyroid adenoma(s) or hyperplasia, parathyroid cancer, or ectopic production of PTH. Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs in 1 of 1000 people; it is three times more common in women than in men, especially after the age of 45, with a peak incidence in the seventh decade, and is more common in those with a history of head and neck irradiation and chronic lithium therapy. There have also been many case reports of multiple concurrent causes of hypercalcemia in patients with malignancy, such as concurrent primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare cause of primary hyperparathyroidism in which the serum calcium is usually severely elevated (>14 mg/dL) in association with a neck mass. Ectopic production of PTH from a carcinoma of the ovaries and small cell carcinoma have been described.

## Rare Causes of Hypercalcemia of Malignancy

## Pseudohypercalcemia

Another rare cause of hypercalcemia is pseudohypercalcemia, so named because it is caused by an abnormality in calcium binding to an abnormal immunoglobulin or by interference with the measurement method. This has been reported in multiple myeloma with binding of calcium to immunoglobulin G lambda (IgGλ) M protein and in two patients with IgM paraprotein that interfered with calcium measurements performed by autoanalyzer but not by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

## Tamoxifen

Patients with breast cancer with osteolytic or mixed lytic and blastic bone metastases can develop hypercalcemia when started on tamoxifen therapy. It is thought to develop from release by breast cancer metastases of cytokines that stimulate the activity of osteoclasts. The hypercalcemia develops within weeks of initiation of tamoxifen and resolves shortly after use of the drug is stopped.

## Evaluation of the Patient

Several major mechanisms account for malignancy-related hypercalcemia, and hence careful evaluation of a patient should include a thorough history with evaluation of clinical signs and symptoms, the presence of underlying malignancy, and its duration and course and a review of medications. This should be followed by biochemical investigation to identify the cause of hypercalcemia.

## Clinical Manifestations

Symptoms of hypercalcemia are dependent on at least two factors: the degree of hypercalcemia (mild, moderate, or severe hypercalcemia) and the rapidity of change in serum calcium. Hypercalcemia is categorized according to the serum total calcium level : mild hypercalcemia, 10.5 to 11.9 mg/dL; moderate hypercalcemia, 12 to 13.9 mg/dL; and severe hypercalcemia, 14 mg/dL or greater. Mild hypercalcemia can be asymptomatic or associated with mild nonspecific symptoms such as lethargy and pain. In contrast, severe, rapidly progressive hypercalcemia can be associated with varying symptoms affecting the major organ systems, including neuropsychiatric, GI, renal, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular symptoms. Patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy have a higher degree of hypercalcemia and develop it over a shorter period of time, and therefore are more symptomatic than patients with other causes of hypercalcemia.

GI symptoms are present in nearly all affected individuals. Mild elevation of calcium may manifest as anorexia and constipation. Patients with severe hypercalcemia may develop nausea and vomiting, but these conditions can easily be confused with the adverse effects of tumor treatment or with symptoms produced directly by the tumor itself. Cramping abdominal pains, such as those seen in persons with primary hyperparathyroidism, are encountered occasionally, but acute pancreatitis or peptic ulceration complicating the hypercalcemia of malignancy is extremely rare.

The major effect of hypercalcemia on the kidney is to impair renal concentrating ability to handle the abnormal calcium load, and the hypercalcemia is aggravated. Tubular damage can manifest as acquired renal tubular acidosis, glycosuria, and aminoaciduria. Renal manifestations consist of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with resultant polyuria. All patients with clinically overt hypercalcemia are volume depleted, explained by polyuria and decreased oral intake due to nausea and vomiting, causing a rise in creatinine and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. Nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis require hypercalcemia of a prolonged duration and are therefore seen in more chronic cases.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms of apathy, mood changes, and fatigue are frequently seen as symptoms of hypercalcemia that can be overlooked and ascribed to the underlying neoplasm. Muscle weakness itself can be profound and can confine the patient to bed. This immobility leads to further calcium mobilization and enhances the hypercalcemia. As hypercalcemia continues to worsen, severe symptomatology, including changes in mental status, confusion, and finally coma may supervene. Rarely, patients may develop a syndrome of posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy (PRES) manifesting with headaches, seizures, and imaging findings of subcortical edema caused by cerebral vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, and systemic inflammation.

Cardiovascular system manifestations are seen as shortening of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram. Patients with severe hypercalcemia may develop malignant ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation.

Bone pain is a frequent symptom of both malignant disease and hypercalcemia. Clearly, bone pain can be related to the presence of metastases within bone that cause areas of increased intramedullary pressure, ischemia, or microfractures, but the symptom is also present in the absence of demonstrable metastatic disease.

## Laboratory Investigations

Measurement of the serum calcium is the first step in evaluation of suspected hypercalcemia. Total serum calcium, which includes both carrier-bound (40% bound to albumin) and unbound calcium, is most commonly used. Because calcium homeostasis is greatly affected by albumin concentration, a serum albumin measurement is necessary for interpretation of the serum calcium level. If the albumin is abnormal, the serum calcium should be corrected for the serum albumin using the following formula:

Ca(corrected mg/dL)=serum Ca(mg/dL)=[0.8(4.0−serum albumin g/dL)]

Ionized calcium is the measure of the active form of calcium and can be used in certain situations in which serum protein levels are altered—for example, malnourished patients or patients with a protein-losing condition (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy) or myeloma, in which calcium binding immunoglobulins are produced. It is important to remember that the albumin–calcium system is highly sensitive to pH, and changes in pH can alter the fraction of calcium ions bound to albumin. For example, in hyperventilation causing respiratory alkalosis the ionized calcium decreases acutely, whereas acidosis resulting in reductions of pH can cause the ionized calcium to rise acutely, both resulting in relatively rapid shifts in ionized calcium. So, ionized calcium also has its limitations and can be inaccurate. Therefore it is advised to confirm elevated serum calcium with a repeat test to ensure these are not spurious results.

Nevertheless, from the conceptual perspective, hypercalcemia can be divided into PTH-mediated and non–PTH-mediated conditions (after confirmation of truly elevated calcium); the next step in evaluating a patient with malignancy-related hypercalcemia consists of measuring both PTH and PTHrP. PTH and PTHrP are similar molecules; therefore both are not concurrently elevated unless there are multiple causes. In most cases of malignancy, serum PTH levels should be suppressed or low normal. High-normal PTH levels in the setting of hypercalcemia are inappropriate and suggest the presence of PTH-mediated hypercalcemia or parathyroid carcinoma. PTHrP levels will be elevated in cases of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy and hence should be measured routinely in the setting of malignancy. Serum phosphorus and other electrolytes should be measured because hypercalcemia due to PTHrP or PTH can cause hypophosphatemia, hyperchloremia, and a mild metabolic alkalosis.

Additional laboratory measurement of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH) 2 D levels to screen for vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia is indicated. In patients with low levels of PTH, PTHrP, and 1,25(OH) 2 D, one might consider hypercalcemia due to osteolytic metastases as the cause of malignancy-related hypercalcemia. However, it is important to note that more than one mechanism of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia can be seen in a particular patient. The pattern of PTH, PTHrP, and 1,25(OH) 2 D values can often be helpful when determining the cause of hypercalcemia as shown in [Table 35.1] .

Other investigations should include a complete blood cell count, measurement of blood urea nitrogen, and measurement of creatinine with estimated glomerular filtration rate to assess renal status. Also, kidney function can affect the serum PTH level. Renal insufficiency stimulates PTH production because it inhibits renal 1α-hydroxylase. Measures of osteoblastic function, such as alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, have little to offer in the diagnosis or management of hypercalcemia. Rare causes of hypercalcemia can include vitamin A toxicity; levels may be checked if the patient is suspected to have taken a large dose of supplements. If multiple myeloma is suspected based on evaluation, serum and urine protein electrophoresis or immunofixation along with a skeletal survey is indicated. If the cause is clear based on the findings of the aforementioned workup, then a 24-hour urine analysis for calcium and creatinine is not routinely performed. Uncommonly, 24-hour urine calcium clearance–to–creatinine clearance ratio (FeCa) can be valuable to differentiate between primary hyperparathyroidism and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia if the course has been indolent, there is a family history of hypercalcemia, and the patient does not have an active cancer that can account for the hypercalcemia. If the FeCa is low (below 0.01), then familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia should be suspected, and definitive evaluation can include genetic testing for mutations in the CASR, AP2S1,or GNA11genes.

Radiographs and isotope bone scans might be pertinent for prognosis and follow-up but do not help delineate the cause of the hypercalcemia, nor are they useful in predicting the response to therapy. Electrocardiographic changes are not infrequent in hypercalcemia. Shortening of the corrected QT interval is the most commonly recognized change, but severe bradyarrhythmias may also occur, so an electrocardiogram can be ordered if the patient is admitted with hypercalcemia.

See the flowchart in [Fig. 35.2] for an overview of diagnosing hypercalcemia of malignancy.

## Treatment

The severity of hypercalcemia and associated symptoms should dictate the aggressiveness of therapy for hypercalcemia of malignancy. Severe hypercalcemia is usually associated with renal insufficiency, volume contraction, and neurologic symptoms requiring immediate treatment, often on an inpatient basis. Moderate hypercalcemia can be associated with fewer symptoms and end-organ manifestations, and mild hypercalcemia can be asymptomatic and may not require immediate therapy. Workup for underlying etiology is important in those who do not need immediate therapy; however, if hypercalcemia is severe, treatment needs to be initiated simultaneously with the workup.

Treatment of hypercalcemia involves treating the underlying malignancy as the primary goal of therapy for all categories of hypercalcemia of malignancy. For those with moderate to severe hypercalcemia, additional concurrent therapy is also indicated.

Additional treatment modalities focus on the cause and mechanism of action causing the hypercalcemia. In general, all patients with malignancy-associated hypercalcemia have volume depletion, increased osteoclastic bone resorption, and increased renal tubular calcium reabsorption, so additional therapies should target these mechanisms. Additional causes that can be targeted include increased intestinal calcium reabsorption (for those with extrarenal 1,25\[OH\] 2 D production) and increased PTH. It is important to thoroughly review the patient’s medication list and discontinue all medications that can worsen hypercalcemia, including calcium, vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, lithium, and theophylline. Early mobilization is important but can be difficult in patients with advanced malignant disease.

## Restoration of Intravascular Volume and Promotion of Renal Calcium Excretion

Volume depletion is extremely common and often occurs with concurrent renal insufficiency in patients with hypercalcemia. Restoration of the normal circulating blood volume and the glomerular filtration rate will increase the fractional excretion of calcium as well as improve renal function.

Treatment is with intravenous (IV) fluids, preferably isotonic saline. There are many algorithms for how to give IV fluids; in general, it is important to restore euvolemia without producing volume overload. A common regimen is to start with an initial bolus of 1 to 2 L followed by maintenance fluids of 150 to 300 mL/h for the next 2 to 3 days or until volume repletion has been achieved. One needs to be cautious in patients with congestive heart failure or anuric renal failure. Smaller volumes of isotonic saline may be indicated to avoid volume overload. Monitoring and replacement of other electrolytes such as potassium and magnesium are important during volume replacement because levels of these electrolytes can often become low.

Furosemide has historically been used to promote calciuresis; however, it should not be routinely used in the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy. It should be reserved only for those with congestive heart failure and for those who need diuresis.

## Reduction of Bone Resorption

## Bisphosphonates

After initial volume repletion, treatment targeting reduction of bone resorption should be considered. The standard of care for treatment of acute hypercalcemia of malignancy is antiresorptive therapy with bisphosphonates.

Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption and are used to inhibit bone resorption caused by tumor and treat hypercalcemia. Bisphosphonates can also reduce morbidity in patients with cancer by decreasing pain and preventing fractures and new bone metastases.

Bisphosphonates were originally developed in the mid-19th century in Germany, and etidronate was the first bisphosphonate used as a human treatment. Bisphosphonates are structural analogues to pyrophosphate ( [Fig. 35.3] ). The potency of the bisphosphonate is determined by each compound's structure. Zoledronic acid is the most potent bisphosphonate—100 times more potent than pamidronate.

Figure 35.3

Structural formulas of commonly studied bisphosphonates in relation to the generic bisphosphonate and to pyrophosphate.

Although many bisphosphonates have been studied in the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy, there are currently two bisphosphonates that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): pamidronate and zoledronic acid. Additional indications for use of both of these medications are multiple myeloma and oncologic solid tumor to the bone.

The antiresorptive mechanisms of pamidronate and zoledronic acid are multifaceted and similar. Both zoledronic acid and pamidronate block osteoclast activity and stimulate osteoclast death. Both compounds inhibit calcium release from bone by inhibiting osteoclast activity driven by tumor-mediated cytokines and enzymes. Pamidronate binds to calcium phosphate in bone to block the demineralization of bone. Pamidronate has been shown to permit bone formation while limiting bone resorption. For patients with moderate hypercalcemia and normal renal function, the recommended dose is a single dose of 60 to 90 mg of pamidronate given intravenously over 2 to 24 hours. In patients with severe hypercalcemia, treatment with a single dose of 90 mg given intravenously over 2 to 24 hours is recommended. Lengthening the duration of infusion decreases the risk for renal insufficiency.

Seventy percent of patients achieved normocalcemia by the seventh day after the administration of pamidronate. Thirty percent to 50% of patients maintained normocalcemia at 14 days after administration of pamidronate. The median time to relapse of hypercalcemia is 18 days after a single dose of pamidronate.

Zoledronic acid received approval for treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in 2001. The recommended dose is 4 mg administered as a single dose intravenously over no less than 15 minutes. Like pamidronate, the vast majority of zoledronic acid is not metabolized but excreted renally and intact. Dose adjustment is not indicated for patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy with mild to moderate renal impairment. Individualized consideration of risk versus benefit should be given to patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy and severe renal impairment, and reduced dose recommendations based on creatinine clearance are available. Eighty-eight percent of patients returned to normocalcemia after administration of a single dose of zoledronic acid. If this does not occur, readministration is recommended after electrolyte levels and kidney function have been monitored carefully for at least 7 days. The median time to relapse of hypercalcemia is 30 days after a single dose of 4 mg of zoledronic acid and 40 days with a dose of 8 mg.

In addition to the two agents that are FDA approved in the United States for treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy, alendronate, etidronate, clodronate, and ibandronate have all been investigated as possible treatments for acute hypercalcemia of malignancy.

Overall, bisphosphonates are well tolerated, and only 15% of the patients treated with pamidronate experienced an adverse event during trials. An acute-phase reaction has been reported within 3 days of administration of zoledronic acid, and the most common associated feature is fever, which occurred in 44% of patients receiving zoledronic acid compared with 33% of patients receiving pamidronate. Less common but well-recognized complications of bisphosphonates are osteonecrosis of the jaw, atypical fractures, and hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia occurred in 1% of patients receiving zoledronic acid and 2% of patients receiving pamidronate. It is not possible to determine the rate of osteonecrosis of the jaw or to definitively attribute that effect to bisphosphonates, but it is suggested that avoiding dental procedures after administration of bisphosphonates can reduce this risk.

Many patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy have renal insufficiency. In a comparison of zoledronic acid 4-mg and pamidronate 90-mg infusions, 11% of patients had renal deterioration after treatment with zoledronic acid compared with 9% with pamidronate. The risk of renal toxicity is decreased with administration of zoledronic acid over 15 minutes instead of 5 minutes. Deterioration of renal function has been documented after initial and single doses of pamidronate, and for this reason the single dose should not exceed 90 mg. Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis has been documented after administration of pamidronate. Creatinine level should be assessed before each treatment.

## Denosumab

Denosumab is FDA approved for treatment of osteoporosis and reduction of skeletal-related events in patients with metastatic bone disease. Denosumab is a human monoclonal antibody the inhibits the binding of RANKL with its receptor RANK. It is second-line therapy in patients with bisphosphonate-resistant hypercalcemia of malignancy and has also specifically been used in those with multiple myeloma and renal dysfunction. One study reported denosumab to be more efficacious than IV zoledronic acid in the prevention of hypercalcemia of malignancy in patients with metastatic bone disease. Subcutaneous denosumab 120 mg every 4 weeks, without renal adjustment, was compared with IV zoledronic acid (4 mg given intravenously every 4 weeks, with renal adjustment and less frequent intervals if renal insufficiency was present). Denosumab delayed time to first episode of hypercalcemia-related malignancy (hazard ratio \[HR\] 0.63) and also reduced the risk of development of recurrent hypercalcemia by 52%. Only 31% of those receiving denosumab developed hypercalcemia, compared with 40% of the zoledronic acid group.

Denosumab can be administered as 120 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks. One study administered 120 mg weekly for 4 weeks and then every 4 weeks after that. Serum calcium was lowered by 64% within 10 days. The side effects are similar to those of bisphosphonates, including hypocalcemia. No renal adjustment is reported to be necessary, given that pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are not affected by renal status. However, the effect has been reported to be more pronounced in those with renal failure, so dose reduction has been advised by some authors (i.e., a dose of 60 mg \[or 0.3 mg/kg\] once, and then readministration in 1 week only if the patient is still hypercalcemic).

Denosumab has also been reported to be efficacious in patients with parathyroid carcinoma resistant to cinacalcet and IV bisphosphonates.

## Reduction of Intestinal Absorption of Calcium

Reducing intestinal calcium absorption is most important in the management of hypercalcemia caused by extrarenal production of 1,25(OH) 2 D, such as in lymphomas, some leukemias, and granulomatous diseases as well as in multiple myeloma. Steroids inhibit conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH) 2 D by 1α-hydroxylase. This in turn lessens intestinal calcium absorption. Steroids have also been reported to reduce tumor production of locally active cytokines in addition to having direct tumorolytic effects. Historically, high dose steroid regimens have been used; however, recent recommendations are for prednisone at 40 to 60 mg daily for 10 days. If steroids are ineffective, they should not be continued, because they can be associated with other morbidities such as hyperglycemia and immunosuppression.

## Reduction of Parathyroid Hormone

Cinacalcet is an allosteric modulator of the calcium sensing receptor and leads to a downregulation of PTH production. It is FDA approved for use in secondary hyperparathyroidism and refractory parathyroid carcinoma. Currently, its use for treatment of hypercalcemia has been limited to parathyroid carcinoma, for which it is very effective at lowering PTH and calcium levels. It has not been studied extensively clinically with other causes of hypercalcemia of malignancy; however, Colloton and colleagues evaluated the ability of cinacalcet to attenuate hypercalcemia due to PTHrP excess. They found that cinacalcet resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of calcium and normalization of phosphorus levels in mice with hypercalcemia due to Leydig and colon tumors. The mechanism was further investigated in parathyroidectomized rats that were hypercalcemic because of PTHrP. Cinacalcet attenuated PTHrP-mediated elevations in serum calcium and also resulted in increased serum calcitonin. The authors concluded that cinacalcet's mechanism in treating hypercalcemia is a result of increased calcitonin release and not direct effects on tumor cells.

## Other Treatments

## Gallium Nitrate

Gallium nitrate is approved for cancer-related hypercalcemia that is unresponsive to adequate hydration and bisphosphonates and appears to be helpful in hypercalcemia mediated by PTHrP and tamoxifen.

The mechanism of action is not fully understood. However, it has been reported to inhibit osteoclast mediated bone resorption, stimulate bone formation, and alter mineral composition of bone. When compared with IV pamidronate, gallium appeared to have similar calcium-lowering effects overall, but gallium appeared to be more effective in epidermoid tumors, with 68% responding to therapy versus 33% with pamidronate. Gallium has also been shown to be effective in tamoxifen-induced hypercalcemia and resulted in normocalcemia while allowing affected patients to remain on tamoxifen. The recommended dose is 100 to 200 mg/m 2 IV over 24 hours for 5 days. It is well tolerated, and there does not appear to be significant nephrotoxicity, but it is not currently FDA approved for use in the United States.

## Calcitonin

Calcitonin is a 32–amino acid hormone produced by the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid. Calcitonin inhibits osteoclasts and also increases calcium excretion in the urine. It can be used in the acute treatment of hypercalcemia and is often used in conjunction with IV bisphosphonates for more rapid correction of hypercalcemia. Unfortunately, tachyphylaxis occurs after about 3 days, so it is not a long-term therapeutic option. It is available as a synthetic salmon calcitonin and natural porcine calcitonin. It is given as 4 to 8 IU subcutaneously or intramuscularly every 6 to 12 hours. The effect should be seen within 4 to 6 hours. Side effects include nausea and hypersensitivity to the salmon or porcine preparations.

Glucocorticoids have been reported to enhance the effect of calcitonin by upregulation of the cell surface calcitonin receptors and creation of new ones on the osteoclast. Steroids in addition to calcitonin have the potential to increase the amount of time calcitonin can be used before tachyphylaxis occurs.

## Hemodialysis

Hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy with low or no calcium in the dialysate bath has been used in severe refractory hypercalcemia. Historically, this therapy was used more often, but now with newer agents, there is not as much of a need for hemodialysis. Current indications include those with oliguric or anuric renal failure and volume overload refractory to fluids and diuretics and those with severe symptoms despite the use of the aforementioned therapies. Severe symptoms despite adequate hydration and IV bisphosphonates can also be an indication. Levels of other electrolytes, specifically phosphorus, need to be monitored closely. The effects can be expected to last hours to days.

## Long-Term Considerations

Hypercalcemia often occurs in more advanced stages of malignancy and is a poor prognostic sign. Life expectancy has been reported at weeks to months. It is important to discuss overall prognosis and wishes of the patient before embarking on therapy. However, even in those who have chosen palliative care and are not treating their underlying malignancy, treatment with IV bisphosphonates has been shown to improve symptoms and also prolong survival, even if they do not attain normocalcemia.
