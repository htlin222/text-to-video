## Introduction

*This *Journal* feature begins with a case vignette highlighting a common clinical problem. Evidence supporting various strategies is then presented, followed by a review of formal guidelines, when they exist. The article ends with the authors’ clinical recommendations.*

**A 36-year-old man comes to establish care with a primary care clinician. He has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. He was born and lived in India until 1 year ago, when he came to the United States. He reports never having had tuberculosis or tuberculosis testing, although when the patient was a child, his father was treated for tuberculosis disease. The patient received bacille Calmette–Guérin vaccine as an infant. He reports no cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Should testing for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* infection be performed and, if so, how? If testing shows evidence of *M. tuberculosis* infection, how should this patient be treated?**

## The Clinical Problem

One fourth of the world’s population is infected with *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the causative agent of tuberculosis.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref1" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">1</a></sup> From a clinical-management perspective, two states of *M. tuberculosis* infection are recognized — latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and active tuberculosis disease — although infection and immunologic control exist across a spectrum. LTBI is a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by *M. tuberculosis* antigens without evidence of clinically manifested active tuberculosis and with bacillary replication absent or below some undefined threshold as a result of immunologic control. Most persons with LTBI never become sick with tuberculosis; however, approximately 5 to 15% have progression to tuberculosis disease.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref2,ref3,ref4,ref5" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">2-5</a></sup> Tuberculosis disease results from bacterial replication and includes tissue damage and inflammation, which lead to clinical manifestations. Common signs and symptoms include fever, sweats, fatigue, and weight loss, as well as cough if the lungs are affected. Tuberculosis disease can involve any tissue and organ system, with diverse manifestations.

## Key Clinical Points

### Latent Tuberculosis Infection

*   Prevention of progression from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to tuberculosis disease is an important individual and public health goal.
    
*   Adults and children should be screened for risk factors for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* exposure and for risk factors for progression to tuberculosis disease. Persons who screen positive should be tested for *M. tuberculosis* infection, preferably with the use of an interferon-γ release assay. Persons who test positive for *M. tuberculosis* infection should be assessed for tuberculosis disease.
    
*   Persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for progression to tuberculosis disease generally should be treated for LTBI and followed until treatment is completed.
    
*   Preferred LTBI treatment regimens include 3 months of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid, 4 months of once-daily rifampin, or 3 months of once-daily isoniazid plus rifampin. Isoniazid administered once daily for 6 or 9 months is an alternative.
    
*   Risk factors for hepatotoxic effects and drug–drug interactions should be considered when the LTBI treatment regimen is selected.
    

Prevention of progression from LTBI to tuberculosis disease is an important individual and public health goal because persons with LTBI are a reservoir for incident tuberculosis disease. Two principles form the basis for guidance about whom to test for LTBI and whom to treat for LTBI. First, infection with *M. tuberculosis* requires previous exposure to someone with tuberculosis disease, and therefore asking about known exposure and epidemiologic risk factors for exposure is important. Second, for a person infected with *M. tuberculosis*, the risk of progression to tuberculosis disease is determined by their immune competence and the time since initial infection; therefore, eliciting biologic risk factors for progression is important.

## Strategies and Evidence

## Identification of Persons Who Should Be Tested for LTBI

Figure 1. ![](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/2021/nejm_2021.385.issue-24/nejmcp2108501/20211206/images/img_medium/nejmcp2108501_f1.jpeg)Figure 1. Algorithm for Deciding Whom to Test and Whom to Treat for Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI).

This algorithm is intended for use in asymptomatic persons and is not intended for use in the evaluation of persons who present for medical care with signs or symptoms of active tuberculosis disease. High-priority risk factors are household or other close contact with someone with infectious active tuberculosis disease; birth, residence, or prolonged travel (>1 mo) in a setting in which tuberculosis disease is common; other circumstances based on local epidemiology (e.g., corrections facilities and homeless shelters); and immunosuppression. Biologic risk factors for progression of LTBI to active tuberculosis disease are immunosuppression; diabetes mellitus; chronic kidney disease; leukemia or lymphoma; cancer of the head or neck; chronic malabsorption, gastrectomy, or intestinal bypass; a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 20 or less; silicosis; current or former smoking status; or an age of 5 years or younger.

Table 1. ![](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/2021/nejm_2021.385.issue-24/nejmcp2108501/20211206/images/img_medium/nejmcp2108501_t1.jpeg)Table 1. Risk-Based Approach for Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) Testing and Treatment.

All adults and children should have an assessment of risk factors for *M. tuberculosis* exposure and risk factors for progression from LTBI to tuberculosis disease at least once as a component of routine primary care ([Figure 1](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html# "View full size")).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref6" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">6</a></sup> Exposure risk is driven by tuberculosis epidemiology and exposure history. In 2020, the United States had a tuberculosis incidence of 2.2 per 100,000 persons, but most countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Pacific Islands have substantially higher incidence.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref7,ref8" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">7,8</a></sup> Persons who were born, lived, or had prolonged travel (>1 month) in these higher-incidence settings should undergo testing for LTBI regardless of duration of residence in the United States ([Table 1](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html# "View full size")).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref9" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">9</a></sup> Within lower-incidence countries, there are specific settings (e.g., correctional facilities and homeless shelters) with higher tuberculosis incidence that warrant testing for LTBI; local health departments can provide guidance about epidemiology and local regulatory requirements for LTBI testing.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref6,ref9" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">6,9</a></sup> Close contact with a person with infectious tuberculosis disease is a risk factor for *M. tuberculosis* infection, with the risk of progression to tuberculosis disease being highest in the first 2 years after infection. Persons with immunosuppressive conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and iatrogenic immunosuppression, typically have substantially increased risk of progression from LTBI to tuberculosis disease, such that routine testing for LTBI is indicated.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref3,ref6" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">3,6</a></sup>

Several other medical conditions are associated with a modestly increased risk of progression from LTBI to tuberculosis disease but are not considered to be independent indications for LTBI testing ([Table 1](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html# "View full size")).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref3,ref6" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">3,6</a></sup> Testing for *M. tuberculosis* infection generally is not warranted in asymptomatic persons without epidemiologic risk of infection or biologic risk factors for progression to tuberculosis disease, because the positive predictive value of available tests is low when the pretest probability of infection is low.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref6,ref10" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">6,10</a></sup>

## Diagnosis and Evaluation

### *Tests to Detect *M. tuberculosis* Infection*

There are no direct microbiologic tests for diagnosis of LTBI. Instead, interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) and tuberculin skin testing provide indirect assessment of infection through detection of cell-mediated immune responses to stimulation by *M. tuberculosis* antigens. These tests cannot discriminate LTBI from tuberculosis disease, and they cannot be used to monitor treatment efficacy because immunologic responses that are detected by the tests are long-lasting even after effective treatment. Current U.S. guidelines give preference to the use of IGRAs in adults and older children, but tuberculin skin tests are considered to be acceptable.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref6,ref10" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">6,10</a></sup>

Figure 2. ![](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/2021/nejm_2021.385.issue-24/nejmcp2108501/20211206/images/img_medium/nejmcp2108501_f2.jpeg)Figure 2. Key Features of Tests for the Detection of Infection with *M. tuberculosis*.

The T-SPOT.*TB* interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) includes a result category of “borderline,” which reflects results that approach but do not reach the threshold for positivity. In such cases, clinicians can repeat the test, perform a different test, or interpret the test on the basis of pretest probability (i.e., as negative in a person with a low likelihood of infection and low risk of progression to tuberculosis disease and as positive if the likelihood of infection or progression is high). The QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus IGRA includes a result category of “indeterminate.” Indeterminate results represent either a low interferon-γ concentration from the mitogen positive control tube or a high interferon-γ concentration from the nil negative control tube. Indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus results provide no information about the *M. tuberculosis* infection status of the patient; in such cases, clinicians should repeat the test or use a different test. In some persons who are infected with *M. tuberculosis*, a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to the tuberculin skin test can wane, especially after many years, resulting in a negative tuberculin skin test. However, the intradermal inoculation of purified protein derivative (PPD) can itself stimulate the ability to mount a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, thereby causing a positive reaction (a “boost”) on subsequent tuberculin skin tests. This newly positive (“boosted”) reaction could be incorrectly interpreted as evidence of new *M. tuberculosis* infection. BCG denotes bacille Calmette–Guérin vaccine strain, ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and PBMCs peripheral-blood mononuclear cells.

The tuberculin skin test and IGRAs differ with respect to practical aspects, readout, and accuracy ([Figure 2](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html# "View full size")).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref11" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">11</a></sup> IGRAs are in vitro assays that require phlebotomy and have objective results but rely on laboratory expertise, equipment, and reagents. In vivo tuberculin skin testing requires two clinical visits plus administration and interpretation by a trained provider. IGRAs are more specific than tuberculin skin testing for the detection of *M. tuberculosis* infection. Vaccination against bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) can cause a positive tuberculin skin test owing to shared antigenic components with purified protein derivative, although the effect on the tuberculin skin test of BCG received in infancy is minimal, especially 10 years or more after vaccination.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref12" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">12</a></sup> IGRA results are unaffected by previous BCG vaccination, because stimulatory antigens that are used in these assays are absent from BCG vaccines. In settings of low tuberculosis prevalence, the specificity of IGRAs is more than 95%; the specificity of tuberculin skin tests is also more than 95% in populations without BCG vaccination but is lower in populations in which BCG vaccines are administered.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref13,ref14" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">13,14</a></sup> Nevertheless, IGRAs can yield false positive results, particularly when used in low-risk populations.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref15" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">15</a></sup>

Estimated sensitivities of tuberculin skin tests and IGRAs have relied on the assessment of performance in patients with tuberculosis disease as a reference standard and have varied widely. The T-SPOT.*TB* and QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus IGRAs have sensitivities of approximately 90%, whereas that of tuberculin skin tests is approximately 80%.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref13,ref14,ref16" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">13,14,16</a></sup> Host immunocompromise, including that arising from tuberculosis disease itself, can be associated with false negative skin tests and IGRAs.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref17,ref18" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">17,18</a></sup> For IGRAs and tuberculin skin testing, there are positive associations between the risk of progression to tuberculosis disease and test quantitative results, but this population-level observation is not readily translatable to the individual patient because immunocompromise can cause low quantitative results in a person at high risk for tuberculosis disease.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref19,ref20" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">19,20</a></sup>

### *Evaluation of Persons with Positive Test Results*

A diagnosis of LTBI requires the ruling out of tuberculosis disease by assessment for signs and symptoms of tuberculosis disease plus chest radiography. Findings suggestive of tuberculosis disease should trigger individualized evaluation that usually includes obtaining sputum specimens for mycobacterial culture and performing smear microscopy and nucleic acid amplification testing and that may include further imaging, bronchoscopy, and biopsy of affected tissues.

## Antimicrobial Treatment for LTBI

### *Identification of Appropriate Candidates for Treatment*

Randomized, controlled trials have shown that antimicrobial treatment of LTBI is effective in preventing progression to tuberculosis disease overall and in children and persons living with HIV and reducing mortality among adults with HIV infection.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref21,ref22,ref23,ref24,ref25" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">21-25</a></sup> Decisions about whether to recommend LTBI treatment are based on risks of adverse effects from treatment (discussed below) weighed against the risk of development of tuberculosis disease. Persons with LTBI who are at increased risk for progression to tuberculosis disease ([Table 1](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html# "View full size")) generally should be offered LTBI treatment to prevent illness and death associated with tuberculosis disease.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref6" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">6</a></sup> All persons with LTBI should undergo testing for HIV infection.

### *Rifamycin-Containing Regimens (Preferred)*

Rifamycin-based treatments are now the preferred approach for LTBI treatment because they have similar or better efficacy and higher completion rates than isoniazid monotherapy. The randomized, controlled PREVENT TB trial compared 3 months of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid, administered by directly observed therapy, with 9 months of participant-administered daily isoniazid in 7731 persons at high risk for tuberculosis disease. In the trial, a 3-month course of rifapentine and isoniazid was noninferior to a 9-month course of isoniazid with respect to the cumulative rate of tuberculosis disease (0.19% vs. 0.43%) and was associated with a higher rate of treatment completion (82.1% vs. 69.0%, P<0.001) and a lower rate of drug-related hepatotoxic effects (0.4% vs. 2.7%, P<0.001).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref26" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">26</a></sup> Efficacy similar to that of longer isoniazid regimens, a high completion rate, and a good safety profile were confirmed in studies involving children 2 years of age or older and in studies involving adults with HIV infection.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref27,ref28,ref29" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">27-29</a></sup> A phase 4 randomized trial showed a similarly high rate of completion of a participant-administered 3-month course of rifapentine and isoniazid in the United States and elsewhere.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref30" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">30</a></sup>

A multinational, randomized, controlled trial that involved more than 6000 adults compared 4 months of once-daily rifampin with 9 months of isoniazid for LTBI treatment.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref31" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">31</a></sup> The 4-month regimen had similar efficacy to the 9-month regimen (0.10 and 0.11 cases of active tuberculosis disease per 100 person-years, respectively) and was associated with a higher completion rate (78.8% and 63.2%, respectively; P<0.001), fewer overall adverse events, and fewer hepatotoxic effects (0.3% and 1.8%, respectively; P<0.001).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref31" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">31</a></sup> Retrospective observational studies involving patients at public health clinics in North America had similar findings.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref32,ref33,ref34" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">32-34</a></sup> A regimen of 3 months of once-daily isoniazid plus rifampin has been shown to have an efficacy and safety that are similar to those of daily isoniazid administered for 6 to 12 months.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref35" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">35</a></sup>

Table 2. ![](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/2021/nejm_2021.385.issue-24/nejmcp2108501/20211206/images/img_medium/nejmcp2108501_t2.jpeg)Table 2. Dose, Frequency, and Prescribing Information for Recommended Regimens for Treatment of LTBI.

Rifampin and rifapentine-containing LTBI treatment regimens are less commonly associated with hepatotoxic effects than is isoniazid.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref26,ref31,ref34,ref36" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">26,31,34,36</a></sup> However, rifampin and rifapentine induce cytochrome P450 enzymes and transporters, causing reductions in the plasma concentrations of certain drugs ([Table 2](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html# "View full size")). Rifamycins can cause neutropenia or thrombocytopenia as well as a flulike systemic drug reaction that rarely includes hypotension and syncope<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref41" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">41</a></sup> ([Table 2](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html# "View full size")).

### *Isoniazid Monotherapy (Alternative)*

Isoniazid monotherapy has long been used for LTBI treatment. However, given its longer treatment duration, lower completion rates, and higher rates of hepatotoxic effects as compared with rifamycin-based regimens, isoniazid monotherapy is no longer considered in U.S. guidelines to be a preferred LTBI treatment.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref6" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">6</a></sup> Isoniazid decreases the risk of tuberculosis disease among persons with a positive tuberculin skin test, including adults and children without HIV infection and adults with HIV infection.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref21,ref22,ref23" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">21-23</a></sup> A pre–HIV era trial that involved approximately 28,000 persons at high risk for progression to tuberculosis disease showed that treatment with 12 months or 6 months of isoniazid was more effective than treatment for 3 months (75%, 65%, and 21% lower incidence of tuberculosis disease, respectively, than with placebo), thereby establishing 6 to 12 months as the target duration.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref39,ref40" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">39,40</a></sup> The effectiveness of isoniazid monotherapy is diminished by completion rates of 50% or less in clinical practice.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref42" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">42</a></sup> Isoniazid can cause clinically significant hepatotoxic effects, which occurred in 2 to 3% of persons receiving isoniazid LTBI treatment in clinical trials<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref26,ref31,ref36" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">26,31,36</a></sup> ([Table 2](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html# "View full size")). In a retrospective cohort of all persons starting isoniazid LTBI treatment in Quebec, Canada, between 2003 and 2007, a total of 15 of 9684 (0.2%) had severe hepatotoxic effects, including 1 adult who died and 2 who received liver transplants.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref34" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">34</a></sup> Isoniazid can cause peripheral neuropathy, which can be mitigated by administration of pyridoxine.

### *Regimen Selection*

Regimen selection is influenced by coexisting conditions and drug–drug interactions ([Table 2](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html# "View full size")). The presence of risk factors for hepatotoxic effects (e.g., previous viral hepatitis, known liver disease, regular alcohol use, injection drug use, pregnancy or less than 3 months post partum, medications with potential hepatotoxic effects, and older age) should be determined by medical history; if present, baseline laboratory testing for measurements of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) should be performed. Daily rifampin or once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine is generally preferred over isoniazid monotherapy in persons with underlying risks for hepatotoxic effects. Pregnancy testing should be performed in persons of childbearing potential. The regimen of weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid has not been adequately studied in pregnancy and is not currently recommended<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref6,ref37" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">6,37</a></sup>; detailed guidance is provided in the [Supplementary Appendix](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMcp2108501/suppl_file/nejmcp2108501_appendix.pdf), which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Concomitant medications should be reviewed for potential drug–drug interactions with antimicrobial agents administered for LTBI treatment ([Table 2](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html# "View full size")). A baseline complete blood count is recommended for persons with coexisting conditions.

### *Monitoring during Treatment*

Monitoring should be performed at least monthly to assess for adverse effects, adherence, and signs or symptoms suggestive of active tuberculosis disease. Assessment of AST and ALT levels and a complete blood count should be performed if there are signs or symptoms of potential hepatotoxic effects, hypersensitivity reaction, or easy bruising or bleeding. These tests should be performed periodically in asymptomatic persons with previous abnormal aminotransferase levels, heavy alcohol use, or other risks for hepatotoxic effects.

## Areas of Uncertainty

Strategies are needed to better identify, and thereby prioritize for preventive treatment, the subgroup of *M. tuberculosis*–infected persons who will have progression to tuberculosis disease. Although the status of *M. tuberculosis* infection is often viewed as binary (i.e., LTBI vs. tuberculosis disease), this is inaccurate. Infection exists within a continuous spectrum of bacterial metabolic activity and immunologic responses and includes intermediate states of “incipient” and “subclinical” tuberculosis (Fig. S1 in the [Supplementary Appendix](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMcp2108501/suppl_file/nejmcp2108501_appendix.pdf)).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref43,ref44" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">43,44</a></sup> Biomarkers are needed to distinguish persons at high risk for progression or who are already having progression from those in whom any persisting *M. tuberculosis* has been eliminated or is being effectively controlled; limited data support associations between certain host transcriptional signatures and the risk of progression.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref45" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">45</a></sup>

More data are needed on the efficacy and safety of ultrashort LTBI treatments. The randomized, controlled BRIEF TB/A5279 (Brief Rifapentine–Isoniazid Efficacy for TB \[Tuberculosis\] Prevention/A5279) trial compared 1 month of daily rifapentine plus isoniazid with 9 months of isoniazid in 3000 participants with HIV who were receiving antiretroviral therapy<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref36" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">36</a></sup>; the 1-month regimen was noninferior to 9 months of isoniazid for the primary composite end point of tuberculosis diagnosis, death from tuberculosis, or death from unknown cause (incidence rate, 0.65 per 100 person-years and 0.67 per 100 person-years, respectively)<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref36" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">36</a></sup> and was associated with a significantly higher completion rate (97% and 90%, respectively). The 1-month regimen is included as an alternative choice in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines but not in current U.S. guidelines, and its efficacy and safety have not been established beyond the studied population of adults and adolescents living with HIV mostly in settings with a high incidence of tuberculosis.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref46" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">46</a></sup> The roles of new drugs for LTBI treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov number, [NCT03568383. opens in new tab](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03568383)) and of vaccines for preventing infection and progression ([NCT04453293. opens in new tab](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCTNCT04453293) and [NCT03512249. opens in new tab](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCTNCT03512249)) are being investigated.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref47,ref48" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">47,48</a></sup> Inclusion of children and pregnant persons in LTBI treatment trials is essential for informing safety and efficacy in these populations and accelerating their access to new regimens.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref49" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">49</a></sup>

## Guidelines

Guidelines for the evaluation and management of LTBI have been issued by the WHO and regional entities.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref45" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">45</a></sup> Recommendations differ somewhat across guidelines, reflecting regional differences in tuberculosis epidemiology and health systems. Recommendations in this article are concordant with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref6,ref10,ref37,ref38" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">6,10,37,38</a></sup>

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The asymptomatic patient in the vignette has epidemiologic risk factors for *M. tuberculosis* infection, and testing for *M. tuberculosis* infection is indicated. Use of an IGRA is preferred over tuberculin skin testing and has specificity advantages in this person who received a BCG vaccine. If testing indicates *M. tuberculosis* infection, chest radiography and clinical assessment should be performed to evaluate for tuberculosis disease, and he should undergo testing for HIV infection. Clinical assessment should elucidate coexisting conditions that increase the risk of progression from LTBI to tuberculosis disease, if this information has not already been gathered. We would assess AST and ALT levels and perform a complete blood count before initiating therapy, although these studies are not strictly recommended in current guidelines for persons without coexisting conditions or risk factors for hepatotoxic effects. If there is no evidence of tuberculosis disease and aminotransferase levels are normal, then LTBI treatment should be initiated with one of the preferred rifamycin-based regimens, given their similar or greater efficacy and higher completion rates as compared with isoniazid monotherapy. Our practice would be to recommend 3 months of once-weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid; an alternative would be 4 months of daily rifampin. Monthly clinical follow-up is warranted to assess for medication adverse effects and adherence and for any signs or symptoms that could indicate progression to tuberculosis disease. If pretreatment aminotransferase results were normal for a person taking a rifamycin-containing preferred regimen, our practice would be to check aminotransferase levels and perform a complete blood count after 1 month of treatment and, if findings were normal, thereafter monitor clinically without laboratory testing unless there were new symptoms of an adverse drug reaction.

† Tuberculin skin test (TST) results are interpreted at the listed positivity thresholds on the basis of epidemiologic or host risk and to improve test positive and negative predictive values. Interferon-γ release assays currently have absolute thresholds for positivity without incorporation of host or epidemiologic risk.

| --- | --- | --- |
| **Preferred** |  |  |
| Isoniazid plus rifapentine once weekly for 3 mo (12 doses)[§](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#t2fn4) |
*   Isoniazid: 15 mg/kg/dose rounded up to nearest 50 or 100 mg; maximum dose, 900 mg
    
*   Rifapentine: 750 mg per dose if weight is 32.1–49.9 kg; 900 mg per dose if weight is ≥50 kg; maximum dose, 900 mg
    

 |

*   Administration: taking with high-fat foods increases rifapentine absorption and is recommended. Avoid concomitant aluminum-containing antacids and foods with high monoamine content.
    
*   Adverse reactions: possible hypersensitivity reaction (3.8%), rash (0.8%), hepatotoxic effects (0.4%).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref26" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">26</a></sup> Hypersensitivity reactions can include hypotension, bronchospasm, angioedema, conjunctivitis, and urticaria.
    
*   Drug–drug interactions: rifapentine causes reductions in plasma concentrations of certain drugs, including warfarin, apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, hormonal contraceptives, levothyroxine, methadone, and many HIV antiretroviral drugs. The effect of once-weekly rifapentine appears to be less than that of daily rifampin, but data are limited. For interactions with isoniazid, see below.
    

 |
| Rifampin once daily for 4 mo | 10 mg/kg/day; maximum daily dose, 600 mg |

*   Administration: taking on an empty stomach is preferable, if side effects are acceptable.
    
*   Adverse reactions: hepatotoxic effects (0.3%), rash or other allergy (0.2%), hematologic toxic effects (0.2%), unacceptable GI adverse events (0.1%).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref31" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">31</a></sup>
    
*   Drug–drug interactions: as for rifapentine, above.
    

 |
| Isoniazid plus rifampin once daily for 3 mo |

*   Isoniazid: 5 mg/kg/day; maximum daily dose, 300 mg
    
*   Rifampin: 10 mg/kg/day; maximum daily dose, 600 mg
    

 |

*   Administration: taking on an empty stomach is preferable, if side effects are acceptable. Avoid concomitant aluminum-containing antacids and foods with high monoamine content.
    
*   Adverse reactions: limited published data; hepatotoxic effects (1–6%), rash (1–8%), unacceptable GI adverse events (0–6%).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref35" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">35</a></sup> Isoniazid can cause peripheral neuropathy that can be mitigated by pyridoxine (25–50 mg/day).[¶](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#t2fn5)
    
*   Drug–drug interactions: as for rifapentine (above) and isoniazid (below).

| **Alternative** |  |  |
| Isoniazid once daily for 6 mo[‖](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#t2fn6)[\*\*](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#t2fn7) | 5 mg/kg/day; maximum daily dose, 300 mg |

*   Administration: taking on an empty stomach is preferable, if side effects are acceptable. Avoid concomitant aluminum-containing antacids and foods with high monoamine content.
    
*   Adverse reactions: hepatotoxic effects (2–3%), rash (0.6%), possible hypersensitivity (0.5%).<sup><a data-behavior="ShowPopupTip" data-popup-content-ids="ref26,ref31,ref36" href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#">26,31,36</a></sup> Isoniazid can cause peripheral neuropathy that can be mitigated by pyridoxine (25–50 mg/day).[¶](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#t2fn5)
    
*   Drug–drug interactions: Isoniazid can increase the serum concentrations of carbamazepine, phenytoin, warfarin, disulfiram, and others. Isoniazid can decrease the serum concentrations of itraconazole and ketoconazole.
    

 |
| Isoniazid once daily for 9 mo[‖](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#t2fn6)[††](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#t2fn8) | Same as above | Same as above |

† With respect to priority, “preferred” indicates excellent side-effect profile and efficacy, shorter treatment duration, and higher completion rates than longer regimens and therefore higher effectiveness; “alternative” indicates good efficacy but lower completion rates than shorter regimens and therefore lower effectiveness. The guidelines for regimens do not apply in circumstances in which there is evidence that the infecting strain of *M. tuberculosis* is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin.

 |
|

§ A regimen of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine is not recommended for use in pregnant persons or those who anticipate becoming pregnant during the treatment period because its safety in these populations has not been adequately studied.



 |
|

¶ Pyridoxine is recommended for persons with preexisting neuropathy or neuropathy risk factors such as diabetes or HIV infection.



 |
|

‖ Isoniazid may also be administered twice weekly by directly observed therapy for 6 or 9 months, at a dose of 15 mg per kilogram per dose for adults.



 |
|

\*\* Once-daily isoniazid is strongly recommended for HIV-negative adults who are unable to take a preferred regimen. For persons living with HIV infection, either 6 or 9 months of isoniazid can be used.



 |
|

†† The recommendation for a 9-month regimen emerged after a reanalysis of data showed that increased protection was obtained with 9 to 10 months of treatment; clinical-trial data are lacking that directly compare 9 months of isoniazid with other durations.<sup>3940</sup>
