Signs and symptoms â€” Unless cardiac tamponade is present, physical signs are so insensitive and nonspecific that they are of historic rather than practical interest. As an example, the ability to percuss cardiac dullness beyond the apical point of maximal impulse is consistent with pericardial effusion, but it depends upon the absence of disease of the lower lobe of the left lung or left pleura and the expertise of the examiner. Ewart's sign (which includes a triangular area of dullness at the tip of the left scapula along with tubular breath sounds and egophony at the same location) suffers from similar limitations [1].
Most patients without a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion will have no symptoms specific to the effusion, but they may have symptoms related to the underlying cause (eg, fever in the setting of pericarditis, etc). Thus, pericardial effusions are often discovered incidentally during evaluation of other cardiopulmonary diseases. However, patients with a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion leading to cardiac tamponade usually present with signs and symptoms related to impaired cardiac function (ie, fatigue, dyspnea, elevated jugular venous pressure, edema). (See "Cardiac tamponade".)
